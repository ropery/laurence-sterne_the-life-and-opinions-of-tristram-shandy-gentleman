			<p>Now my uncle <i>Toby</i> had one evening laid down his pipe upon the table, and was counting over to himself upon his finger ends (beginning at his thumb) all <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> <i>Wadman’s</i> perfections one by one; and happening two or three times together, either by omitting some, or counting others twice over, to puzzle himself sadly before he could get beyond his middle finger⁠⸺⁠Prithee, <i>Trim!</i> said he, taking up his pipe again,⁠⸺⁠bring me a pen and ink: <i>Trim</i> brought paper also.</p>
			<p>Take a full sheet⁠⸺⁠<i>Trim!</i> said my uncle <i>Toby</i>, making a sign with his pipe at the same time to take a chair and sit down close by him at the table. The corporal obeyed⁠⸺⁠placed the paper directly before him⁠⸺⁠took a pen, and dipp’d it in the ink.</p>
			<p>—She has a thousand virtues, <i>Trim!</i> said my uncle <i>Toby</i>⁠⸺⁠</p>
			<p>Am I to set them down, an’ please your honour? quoth the corporal.</p>
			<p>⸺⁠But they must be taken in their ranks, replied my uncle <i>Toby</i>; for of them all, <i>Trim</i>, that which wins me most, and which is a security for all the rest, is the compassionate turn and singular humanity of her character⁠—I protest, added my uncle <i>Toby</i>, looking up, as he protested it, towards the top of the ceiling⁠⸺⁠That was I her brother, <i>Trim</i>, a thousand fold, she could not make more constant or more tender enquiries after my sufferings⁠⸺⁠though now no more.</p>
			<p>The corporal made no reply to my uncle <i>Toby’s</i> protestation, but by a short cough⁠—he dipp’d the pen a second time into the inkhorn; and my uncle <i>Toby</i>, pointing with the end of his pipe as close to the top of the sheet at the left hand corner of it, as he could get it⁠⸺⁠the corporal wrote down the word <b>humanity</b> - - - - thus.</p>
			<p>Prithee, corporal, said my uncle <i>Toby</i>, as soon as <i>Trim</i> had done it⁠⸻how often does <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> <i>Bridget</i> enquire after the wound on the cap of thy knee, which thou received’st at the battle of <i>Landen?</i></p>
			<p>She never, an’ please your honour, enquires after it at all.</p>
			<p>That, corporal, said my uncle <i>Toby</i>, with all the triumph the goodness of his nature would permit⁠⸺⁠That shows the difference in the character of the mistress and maid⁠⸺⁠had the fortune of war allotted the same mischance to me, <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> <i>Wadman</i> would have enquired into every circumstance relating to it a hundred times⁠⸺⁠She would have enquired, an’ please your honour, ten times as often about your honour’s groin⁠⸺⁠The pain, <i>Trim</i>, is equally excruciating,⁠⸺⁠and Compassion has as much to do with the one as the other⁠⸺⁠</p>
			<p>⸺⁠God bless your honour! cried the corporal⁠⸺⁠what has a woman’s compassion to do with a wound upon the cap of a man’s knee? had your honour’s been shot into ten thousand splinters at the affair of <i>Landen</i>, <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> <i>Wadman</i> would have troubled her head as little about it as <i>Bridget</i>; because, added the corporal, lowering his voice, and speaking very distinctly, as he assigned his reason⁠⸺⁠</p>
			<p>“The knee is such a distance from the main body⁠⸺⁠whereas the groin, your honour knows, is upon the very <em>curtain</em> of the <em>place</em>.”</p>
			<p>My uncle <i>Toby</i> gave a long whistle⁠⸺⁠but in a note which could scarce be heard across the table.</p>
			<p>The corporal had advanced too far to retire⁠⸺⁠in three words he told the rest⁠⸺⁠</p>
			<p>My uncle <i>Toby</i> laid down his pipe as gently upon the fender, as if it had been spun from the unravellings of a spider’s web⁠⸺⁠</p>
			<p>⸻Let us go to my brother <i>Shandy’s</i>, said he.</p>
