			<p>If anything in this world, which my father said, could have provoked my uncle <i>Toby</i>, during the time he was in love, it was the perverse use my father was always making of an expression of <i>Hilarion</i> the hermit; who, in speaking of his abstinence, his watchings, flagellations, and other instrumental parts of his religion⁠—would say⁠—tho’ with more facetiousness than became an hermit⁠—“That they were the means he used, to make his <em>ass</em> (meaning his body) leave off kicking.”</p>
			<p>It pleased my father well; it was not only a laconick way of expressing⁠⸺⁠but of libelling, at the same time, the desires and appetites of the lower part of us; so that for many years of my father’s life, ’twas his constant mode of expression⁠—he never used the word <em>passions</em> once⁠—but <em>ass</em> always instead of them⁠⸺⁠So that he might be said truly, to have been upon the bones, or the back of his own ass, or else of some other man’s, during all that time.</p>
			<p>I must here observe to you the difference betwixt</p>
			<p class="short-indent">My father’s ass</p>
			<p class="short-indent">and my hobbyhorse⁠—in order to keep characters as separate as may be, in our fancies as we go along.</p>
			<p>For my hobbyhorse, if you recollect a little, is no way a vicious beast; he has scarce one hair or lineament of the ass about him⁠⸺’Tis the sporting little filly-folly which carries you out for the present hour⁠—a maggot, a butterfly, a picture, a fiddlestick⁠—an uncle <i>Toby’s</i> siege⁠—or an <em>anything</em>, which a man makes a shift to get astride on, to canter it away from the cares and solicitudes of life⁠—’Tis as useful a beast as is in the whole creation⁠—nor do I really see how the world would do without it⁠⸺⁠</p>
			<p>⸺⁠But for my father’s ass⁠⸻oh! mount him⁠—mount him⁠—mount him⁠—(that’s three times, is it not?)⁠—mount him not:⁠—’tis a beast concupiscent⁠—and foul befal the man, who does not hinder him from kicking.</p>
