			<p>Was it <i>Mackay’s</i> regiment, quoth my uncle <i>Toby</i>, where the poor grenadier was so unmercifully whipp’d at <i>Bruges</i> about the ducats?⁠—O Christ! he was innocent! cried <i>Trim</i>, with a deep sigh.⁠—And he was whipp’d, may it please your honour, almost to death’s door.⁠—They had better have shot him outright, as he begg’d, and he had gone directly to heaven, for he was as innocent as your honour.⁠⸻I thank thee, <i>Trim</i>, quoth my uncle <i>Toby</i>.⁠⸺⁠I never think of his, continued <i>Trim</i>, and my poor brother <i>Tom’s</i> misfortunes, for we were all three schoolfellows, but I cry like a coward.⁠⸺⁠Tears are no proof of cowardice, <i>Trim</i>.⁠—I drop them ofttimes myself, cried my uncle <i>Toby</i>.⁠⸺⁠I know your honour does, replied <i>Trim</i>, and so am not ashamed of it myself.⁠—But to think, may it please your honour, continued <i>Trim</i>, a tear stealing into the corner of his eye as he spoke⁠—to think of two virtuous lads with hearts as warm in their bodies, and as honest as God could make them⁠—the children of honest people, going forth with gallant spirits to seek their fortunes in the world⁠—and fall into such evils!⁠—poor <i>Tom!</i> to be tortured upon a rack for nothing⁠—but marrying a Jew’s widow who sold sausages⁠—honest <i>Dick Johnson’s</i> soul to be scourged out of his body, for the ducats another man put into his knapsack!⁠—O!⁠—these are misfortunes, cried <i>Trim</i>,⁠—pulling out his handkerchief⁠—these are misfortunes, may it please your honour, worth lying down and crying over.</p>
			<p>—My father could not help blushing.</p>
			<p>’Twould be a pity, <i>Trim</i>, quoth my uncle <i>Toby</i>, thou shouldst ever feel sorrow of thy own⁠—thou feelest it so tenderly for others.⁠—Alack-o-day, replied the corporal, brightening up his face⁠⸻your honour knows I have neither wife or child⁠⸺⁠I can have no sorrows in this world.⁠⸺⁠My father could not help smiling.⁠—As few as any man, <i>Trim</i>, replied my uncle <i>Toby</i>; nor can I see how a fellow of thy light heart can suffer, but from the distress of poverty in thy old age⁠—when thou art passed all services, <i>Trim</i>⁠—and hast outlived thy friends.⁠⸺⁠An’ please your honour, never fear, replied <i>Trim</i>, chearily.⁠⸺⁠But I would have thee never fear, <i>Trim</i>, replied my uncle <i>Toby</i>, and therefore, continued my uncle <i>Toby</i>, throwing down his crutch, and getting up upon his legs as he uttered the word <em>therefore</em>⁠—in recompence, <i>Trim</i>, of thy long fidelity to me, and that goodness of thy heart I have had such proofs of⁠—whilst thy master is worth a shilling⁠⸺⁠thou shalt never ask elsewhere, <i>Trim</i>, for a penny. <i>Trim</i> attempted to thank my uncle <i>Toby</i>⁠—but had not power⁠⸺⁠tears trickled down his cheeks faster than he could wipe them off⁠—He laid his hands upon his breast⁠⸺⁠made a bow to the ground, and shut the door.</p>
			<p>⸺⁠I have left <i>Trim</i> my bowling-green, cried my uncle <i>Toby</i>.⁠⸺⁠My father smiled.⁠⸻I have left him moreover a pension, continued my uncle <i>Toby</i>.⁠⸺⁠My father looked grave.</p>
