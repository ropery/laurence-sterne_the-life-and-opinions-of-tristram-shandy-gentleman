			<p>⸺⁠We’ll not stop two moments, my dear Sir,⁠—only, as we have got through these five volumes, (do, Sir, sit down upon a set⁠⸺⁠they are better than nothing) let us just look back upon the country we have pass’d through.⁠⸺⁠</p>
			<p>⸺⁠What a wilderness has it been! and what a mercy that we have not both of us been lost, or devoured by wild beasts in it!</p>
			<p>Did you think the world itself, Sir, had contained such a number of Jack Asses?⁠⸺⁠How they view’d and review’d us as we passed over the rivulet at the bottom of that little valley!⁠⸺⁠and when we climbed over that hill, and were just getting out of sight⁠—good God! what a braying did they all set up together!</p>
			<p>⸺⁠Prithee, shepherd! who keeps all those Jack Asses? * * *</p>
			<p>⸺⁠Heaven be their comforter⁠⸺⁠What! are they never curried?⁠⸺⁠Are they never taken in in winter?⁠⸺⁠Bray bray⁠—bray. Bray on,⁠—the world is deeply your debtor;⁠⸺⁠louder still⁠—that’s nothing:⁠—in good sooth, you are ill-used:⁠⸺⁠Was I a Jack Asse, I solemnly declare, I would bray in G-fol-re-ut from morning, even unto night.</p>
