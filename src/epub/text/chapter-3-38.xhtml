			<p><em>O Slawkenbergius!</em> thou faithful analyzer of my <i xml:lang="it">Disgrazias</i>⁠—thou sad foreteller of so many of the whips and short turns which in one stage or other of my life have come slap upon me from the shortness of my nose, and no other cause, that I am conscious of.⁠—Tell me, <i>Slawkenbergius!</i> what secret impulse was it? what intonation of voice? whence came it? how did it sound in thy ears?⁠⸺⁠art thou sure thou heard’st it?⁠⸺⁠which first cried out to thee⁠⸻go⁠⸻go, <i>Slawkenbergius!</i> dedicate the labours of thy life⁠⸺⁠neglect thy pastimes⁠⸻call forth all the powers and faculties of thy nature⁠⸺⁠macerate thyself in the service of mankind, and write a grand <b>folio</b> for them, upon the subject of their noses.</p>
			<p>How the communication was conveyed into <i>Slawkenbergius’s</i> sensorium⁠⸺⁠so that <i>Slawkenbergius</i> should know whose finger touch’d the key⁠—and whose hand it was that blew the bellows⁠⸺⁠as <i>Hafen Slawkenbergius</i> has been dead and laid in his grave above fourscore and ten years⁠⸻we can only raise conjectures.</p>
			<p><i>Slawkenbergius</i> was play’d upon, for aught I know, like one of <i>Whitefield’s</i> disciples⁠⸺⁠that is, with such a distinct intelligence, Sir, of which of the two <em>masters</em> it was that had been practising upon his <em>instrument</em>⁠⸻as to make all reasoning upon it needless.</p>
			<p>⸻For in the account which <i>Hafen Slawkenbergius</i> gives the world of his motives and occasions for writing, and spending so many years of his life upon this one work⁠—towards the end of his prolegomena, which by the by should have come first⁠⸺⁠but the bookbinder has most injudiciously placed it betwixt the analytical contents of the book, and the book itself⁠—he informs his reader, that ever since he had arrived at the age of discernment, and was able to sit down coolly, and consider within himself the true state and condition of man, and distinguish the main end and design of his being;⁠⸺⁠or⁠—to shorten my translation, for <i>Slawkenbergius’s</i> book is in <i>Latin</i>, and not a little prolix in this passage⁠—ever since I understood, quoth <i>Slawkenbergius</i>, anything⁠⸺⁠or rather <em>what was what</em>⁠⸺⁠and could perceive that the point of long noses had been too loosely handled by all who had gone before;⁠⸺⁠have I, <i>Slawkenbergius</i>, felt a strong impulse, with a mighty and unresistible call within me, to gird up myself to this undertaking.</p>
			<p>And to do justice to <i>Slawkenbergius</i>, he has entered the list with a stronger lance, and taken a much larger career in it than any one man who had ever entered it before him⁠⸺⁠and indeed, in many respects, deserves to be <em>en-nich’d</em> as a prototype for all writers, of voluminous works at least, to model their books by⁠⸺⁠for he has taken in, Sir, the whole subject⁠—examined every part of it <em>dialectically</em>⁠⸻then brought it into full day; dilucidating it with all the light which either the collision of his own natural parts could strike⁠—or the profoundest knowledge of the sciences had impowered him to cast upon it⁠—collating, collecting, and compiling⁠⸻begging, borrowing, and stealing, as he went along, all that had been wrote or wrangled thereupon in the schools and porticos of the learned: so that <i>Slawkenbergius</i> his book may properly be considered, not only as a model⁠—but as a thorough-stitched <b>digest</b> and regular institute of <em>noses</em>, comprehending in it all that is or can be needful to be known about them.</p>
			<p>For this cause it is that I forbear to speak of so many (otherwise) valuable books and treatises of my father’s collecting, wrote either, plump upon noses⁠⸺⁠or collaterally touching them;⁠⸻such for instance as <i>Prignitz</i>, now lying upon the table before me, who with infinite learning, and from the most candid and scholar-like examination of above four thousand different skulls, in upwards of twenty charnel-houses in <i>Silesia</i>, which he had rummaged⁠⸻has informed us, that the mensuration and configuration of the osseous or bony parts of human noses, in any <em>given</em> tract of country, except <i>Crim Tartary</i>, where they are all crush’d down by the thumb, so that no judgment can be formed upon them⁠—are much nearer alike, than the world imagines;⁠—the difference amongst them being, he says, a mere trifle, not worth taking notice of;⁠⸺⁠but that the size and jollity of every individual nose, and by which one nose ranks above another, and bears a higher price, is owing to the cartilaginous and muscular parts of it, into whose ducts and sinuses the blood and animal spirits being impell’d and driven by the warmth and force of the imagination, which is but a step from it (bating the case of idiots, whom <i>Prignitz</i>, who had lived many years in <i>Turky</i>, supposes under the more immediate tutelage of Heaven)⁠—it so happens, and ever must, says <i>Prignitz</i>, that the excellency of the nose is in a direct arithmetical proportion to the excellency of the wearer’s fancy.</p>
			<p>It is for the same reason, that is, because ’tis all comprehended in <i>Slawkenbergius</i>, that I say nothing likewise of <i>Scroderus</i> (<i>Andrea</i>) who, all the world knows, set himself to oppugn <i>Prignitz</i> with great violence⁠—proving it in his own way, first <em>logically</em>, and then by a series of stubborn facts, “That so far was <i>Prignitz</i> from the truth, in affirming that the fancy begat the nose, that on the contrary⁠—the nose begat the fancy.”</p>
			<p>—The learned suspected <i>Scroderus</i> of an indecent sophism in this⁠—and <i>Prignitz</i> cried out aloud in the dispute, that <i>Scroderus</i> had shifted the idea upon him⁠⸺⁠but <i>Scroderus</i> went on, maintaining his thesis.</p>
			<p>My father was just balancing within himself, which of the two sides he should take in this affair; when <i>Ambrose Paræus</i> decided it in a moment, and by overthrowing the systems, both of <i>Prignitz</i> and <i>Scroderus</i>, drove my father out of both sides of the controversy at once.</p>
			<p>Be witness⁠⸻</p>
			<p>I don’t acquaint the learned reader⁠—in saying it, I mention it only to show the learned, I know the fact myself⁠⸻</p>
			<p>That this <i>Ambrose Paræus</i> was chief surgeon and nose-mender to <i>Francis</i> the ninth of <i>France</i>, and in high credit with him and the two preceding, or succeeding kings (I know not which)⁠—and that, except in the slip he made in his story of <i>Taliacotius’s</i> noses, and his manner of setting them on⁠—he was esteemed by the whole college of physicians at that time, as more knowing in matters of noses, than anyone who had ever taken them in hand.</p>
			<p>Now <i>Ambrose Paræus</i> convinced my father, that the true and efficient cause of what had engaged so much the attention of the world, and upon which <i>Prignitz</i> and <i>Scroderus</i> had wasted so much learning and fine parts⁠⸺⁠was neither this nor that⁠⸺⁠but that the length and goodness of the nose was owing simply to the softness and flaccidity in the nurse’s breast⁠⸻as the flatness and shortness of puisne noses was to the firmness and elastic repulsion of the same organ of nutrition in the hale and lively⁠—which, tho’ happy for the woman, was the undoing of the child, inasmuch as his nose was so snubb’d, so rebuff’d, so rebated, and so refrigerated thereby, as never to arrive <i xml:lang="la">ad mensuram suam legitimam</i>;⁠⸺⁠but that in case of the flaccidity and softness of the nurse or mother’s breast⁠—by sinking into it, quoth <i>Paræus</i>, as into so much butter, the nose was comforted, nourish’d, plump’d up, refresh’d, refocillated, and set a growing forever.</p>
			<p>I have but two things to observe of <i>Paræus</i>; first, That he proves and explains all this with the utmost chastity and decorum of expression:⁠—for which may his soul forever rest in peace!</p>
			<p>And, secondly, that besides the systems of <i>Prignitz</i> and <i>Scroderus</i>, which <i>Ambrose Paræus</i> his hypothesis effectually overthrew⁠—it overthrew at the same time the system of peace and harmony of our family; and for three days together, not only embroiled matters between my father and my mother, but turn’d likewise the whole house and everything in it, except my uncle <i>Toby</i>, quite upside down.</p>
			<p>Such a ridiculous tale of a dispute between a man and his wife, never surely in any age or country got vent through the keyhole of a street-door.</p>
			<p>My mother, you must know⁠⸻but I have fifty things more necessary to let you know first⁠⸺⁠I have a hundred difficulties which I have promised to clear up, and a thousand distresses and domestick misadventures crowding in upon me thick and threefold, one upon the neck of another. A cow broke in (tomorrow morning) to my uncle <i>Toby’s</i> fortifications, and eat up two rations and a half of dried grass, tearing up the sods with it, which faced his horn-work and covered way.⁠⸺⁠<i>Trim</i> insists upon being tried by a court-martial⁠—the cow to be shot⁠—<i>Slop</i> to be <em>crucifix’d</em>⁠—myself to be <em>tristram’d</em> and at my very baptism made a martyr of;⁠⸺⁠poor unhappy devils that we all are!⁠⸺⁠I want swaddling⁠⸻but there is no time to be lost in exclamations⁠⸻I have left my father lying across his bed, and my uncle <i>Toby</i> in his old fringed chair, sitting beside him, and promised I would go back to them in half an hour; and five-and-thirty minutes are laps’d already.⁠⸻Of all the perplexities a mortal author was ever seen in⁠⸺⁠this certainly is the greatest, for I have <i>Hafen Slawkenbergius’s</i> folio, Sir, to finish⁠⸺⁠a dialogue between my father and my uncle <i>Toby</i>, upon the solution of <i>Prignitz</i>, <i>Scroderus</i>, <i>Ambrose Paræus</i>, <i>Ponocrates</i>, and <i>Grangousier</i> to relate⁠—a tale out of <i>Slawkenbergius</i> to translate, and all this in five minutes less than no time at all;⁠⸻such a head!⁠—would to Heaven my enemies only saw the inside of it!</p>
