			<p>Every day for at least ten years together did my father resolve to have it mended⁠—’tis not mended yet;⁠—no family but ours would have borne with it an hour⁠⸺⁠and what is most astonishing, there was not a subject in the world upon which my father was so eloquent, as upon that of door-hinges.⁠⸺⁠And yet at the same time, he was certainly one of the greatest bubbles to them, I think, that history can produce: his rhetorick and conduct were at perpetual handy-cuffs.⁠—Never did the parlour-door open⁠—but his philosophy or his principles fell a victim to it;⁠⸺⁠three drops of oil with a feather, and a smart stroke of a hammer, had saved his honour forever.</p>
			<p>⸺⁠Inconsistent soul that man is!⁠⸺⁠languishing under wounds, which he has the power to heal!⁠—his whole life a contradiction to his knowledge!⁠—his reason, that precious gift of God to him⁠—(instead of pouring in oil) serving but to sharpen his sensibilities⁠—to multiply his pains, and render him more melancholy and uneasy under them⁠—Poor unhappy creature, that he should do so!⁠⸺⁠Are not the necessary causes of misery in this life enow, but he must add voluntary ones to his stock of sorrow;⁠—struggle against evils which cannot be avoided, and submit to others, which a tenth part of the trouble they create him would remove from his heart forever?</p>
			<p>By all that is good and virtuous, if there are three drops of oil to be got, and a hammer to be found within ten miles of <i>Shandy Hall</i>⁠⸻the parlour door hinge shall be mended this reign.</p>
