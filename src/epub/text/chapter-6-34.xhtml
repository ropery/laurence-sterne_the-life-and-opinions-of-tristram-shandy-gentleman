			<p>I told the Christian reader in the beginning of the chapter which preceded my uncle <i>Toby’s</i> apologetical oration,⁠—though in a different trope from what I should make use of now, That the peace of <i>Utrecht</i> was within an ace of creating the same shyness betwixt my uncle <i>Toby</i> and his hobbyhorse, as it did betwixt the queen and the rest of the confederating powers.</p>
			<p>There is an indignant way in which a man sometimes dismounts his horse, which as good as says to him, “I’ll go afoot, Sir, all the days of my life, before I would ride a single mile upon your back again.” Now my uncle <i>Toby</i> could not be said to dismount his horse in this manner; for in strictness of language, he could not be said to dismount his horse at all⁠⸺⁠his horse rather flung him⁠⸺⁠and somewhat <em>viciously</em>, which made my uncle <i>Toby</i> take it ten times more unkindly. Let this matter be settled by state-jockies as they like.⁠⸺⁠It created, I say, a sort of shyness betwixt my uncle <i>Toby</i> and his hobbyhorse.⁠⸺⁠He had no occasion for him from the month of <i>March</i> to <i>November</i>, which was the summer after the articles were signed, except it was now and then to take a short ride out, just to see that the fortifications and harbour of <i>Dunkirk</i> were demolished, according to stipulation.</p>
			<p>The <i>French</i> were so backwards all that summer in setting about that affair, and Monsieur <i>Tugghe</i>, the Deputy from the magistrates of <i>Dunkirk</i>, presented so many affecting petitions to the queen,⁠—beseeching her majesty to cause only her thunderbolts to fall upon the martial works, which might have incurred her displeasure,⁠—but to spare⁠—to spare the mole, for the mole’s sake; which, in its naked situation, could be no more than an object of pity⁠⸺⁠and the queen (who was but a woman) being of a pitiful disposition,⁠—and her ministers also, they not wishing in their hearts to have the town dismantled, for these private reasons, <span>*</span> <span>*</span> <span>*</span> <span>*</span> <span>*</span> <span>*</span> <span>*</span> <span>*</span> <span>*</span> <span>*</span> <span>*</span> <span>*</span>⁠⸺⁠</p>
			<p><span>*</span> <span>*</span> <span>*</span> <span>*</span> <span>*</span> <span>*</span> <span>*</span> <span>*</span> <span>*</span> <span>*</span> <span>*</span> <span>*</span> <span>*</span> <span>*</span> <span>*</span> <span>*</span> <span>*</span> <span>*</span> <span>*</span> <span>*</span>; so that the whole went heavily on with my uncle <i>Toby</i>; insomuch, that it was not within three full months, after he and the corporal had constructed the town, and put it in a condition to be destroyed, that the several commandants, commissaries, deputies, negociators, and intendants, would permit him to set about it.⁠⸺⁠Fatal interval of inactivity!</p>
			<p>The corporal was for beginning the demolition, by making a breach in the ramparts, or main fortifications of the town⁠⸺⁠No,⁠—that will never do, corporal, said my uncle <i>Toby</i>, for in going that way to work with the town, the <i>English</i> garrison will not be safe in it an hour; because if the <i>French</i> are treacherous⁠⸺⁠They are as treacherous as devils, an’ please your honour, said the corporal⁠⸺⁠It gives me concern always when I hear it, <i>Trim</i>, said my uncle <i>Toby</i>,⁠—for they don’t want personal bravery; and if a breach is made in the ramparts, they may enter it, and make themselves masters of the place when they please:⁠⸺⁠Let them enter it, said the corporal, lifting up his pioneer’s spade in both his hands, as if he was going to lay about him with it,⁠—let them enter, an’ please your honour, if they dare.⁠⸺⁠In cases like this, corporal, said my uncle <i>Toby</i>, slipping his right hand down to the middle of his cane, and holding it afterwards truncheon-wise with his forefinger extended,⁠⸺’tis no part of the consideration of a commandant, what the enemy dare,⁠—or what they dare not do; he must act with prudence. We will begin with the outworks both towards the sea and the land, and particularly with fort <i>Louis</i>, the most distant of them all, and demolish it first,⁠—and the rest, one by one, both on our right and left, as we retreat towards the town;⁠⸺⁠then we’ll demolish the mole,⁠—next fill up the harbour,⁠—then retire into the citadel, and blow it up into the air: and having done that, corporal, we’ll embark for <i>England</i>.⁠⸺⁠We are there, quoth the corporal, recollecting himself⁠⸺⁠Very true, said my uncle <i>Toby</i>⁠—looking at the church.</p>
