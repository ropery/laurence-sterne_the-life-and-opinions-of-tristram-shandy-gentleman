				<p>Though I was sensible I had said as many clever things to the commissary as came to six livres four sous, yet I was determined to note down the imposition amongst my remarks before I retired from the place; so putting my hand into my coat-pocket for my remarks⁠—(which, by the by, may be a caution to travellers to take a little more care of <em>their</em> remarks for the future) “my remarks were <em>stolen</em>”⁠⸺⁠Never did sorry traveller make such a pother and racket about his remarks as I did about mine, upon the occasion.</p>
				<p>Heaven! earth! sea! fire! cried I, calling in everything to my aid but what I should⁠⸻My remarks are stolen!⁠—what shall I do?⁠⸺⁠<abbr>Mr.</abbr> Commissary! pray did I drop any remarks, as I stood besides you?⁠⸻</p>
				<p>You dropp’d a good many very singular ones; replied he⁠⸺⁠Pugh! said I, those were but a few, not worth above six livres two sous⁠—but these are a large parcel⁠⸺⁠He shook his head⁠⸺⁠Monsieur <i>Le Blanc!</i> Madam <i>Le Blanc!</i> did you see any papers of mine?⁠—you maid of the house! run upstairs⁠—<i>François!</i> run up after her⁠⸺⁠</p>
				<p>—I must have my remarks⁠⸺⁠they were the best remarks, cried I, that ever were made⁠—the wisest⁠—the wittiest⁠—What shall I do?⁠—which way shall I turn myself?</p>
				<p><i>Sancho Pança</i>, when he lost his ass’s <b>furniture</b>, did not exclaim more bitterly.</p>
