			<p>⸺⁠All you need say of <i>Fontainbleau</i> (in case you are ask’d) is, that it stands about forty miles (south <em>something</em>) from <i>Paris</i>, in the middle of a large forest⁠⸺⁠That there is something great in it⁠⸺⁠That the king goes there once every two or three years, with his whole court, for the pleasure of the chase⁠—and that, during that carnival of sporting, any <i>English</i> gentleman of fashion (you need not forget yourself) may be accommodated with a nag or two, to partake of the sport, taking care only not to out-gallop the king⁠⸺⁠</p>
			<p>Though there are two reasons why you need not talk loud of this to everyone.</p>
			<p>First, Because ’twill make the said nags the harder to be got; and</p>
			<p>Secondly, ’Tis not a word of it true.⁠⸺⁠<i xml:lang="fr">Allons!</i></p>
			<p>As for <b>Sens</b>⁠⸺⁠you may dispatch⁠—in a word⁠⸻“<em>’Tis an archiepiscopal see.</em>”</p>
			<p>⸺⁠For <b>Joigny</b>⁠—the less, I think, one says of it the better.</p>
			<p>But for <b>Auxerre</b>⁠—I could go on forever: for in my grand tour through <i>Europe</i>, in which, after all, my father (not caring to trust me with anyone) attended me himself, with my uncle <i>Toby</i>, and <i>Trim</i>, and <i>Obadiah</i>, and indeed most of the family, except my mother, who being taken up with a project of knitting my father a pair of large worsted breeches⁠—(the thing is common sense)⁠—and she not caring to be put out of her way, she stayed at home, at <b>Shandy Hall</b>, to keep things right during the expedition; in which, I say, my father stopping us two days at <i>Auxerre</i>, and his researches being ever of such a nature, that they would have found fruit even in a desert⁠⸺⁠he has left me enough to say upon <b>Auxerre</b>: in short, wherever my father went⁠⸺⁠but ’twas more remarkably so, in this journey through <i>France</i> and <i>Italy</i>, than in any other stages of his life⁠⸺⁠his road seemed to lie so much on one side of that, wherein all other travellers have gone before him⁠—he saw kings and courts and silks of all colours, in such strange lights⁠⸺⁠and his remarks and reasonings upon the characters, the manners, and customs, of the countries we pass’d over, were so opposite to those of all other mortal men, particularly those of my uncle <i>Toby</i> and <i>Trim</i>⁠—(to say nothing of myself)⁠—and to crown all⁠—the occurrences and scrapes which we were perpetually meeting and getting into, in consequence of his systems and opiniatry⁠—they were of so odd, so mix’d and tragicomical a contexture⁠—That the whole put together, it appears of so different a shade and tint from any tour of <i>Europe</i>, which was ever executed⁠—that I will venture to pronounce⁠—the fault must be mine and mine only⁠—if it be not read by all travellers and travel-readers, till travelling is no more,⁠—or which comes to the same point⁠—till the world, finally, takes it into its head to stand still.⁠⸺⁠</p>
			<p>⸺⁠But this rich bale is not to be open’d now; except a small thread or two of it, merely to unravel the mystery of my father’s stay at <b>Auxerre</b>.</p>
			<p>⸺⁠As I have mentioned it⁠—’tis too slight to be kept suspended; and when ’tis wove in, there is an end of it.</p>
			<p>We’ll go, brother <i>Toby</i>, said my father, whilst dinner is coddling⁠—to the abby of Saint <i>Germain</i>, if it be only to see these bodies, of which Monsieur <i>Sequier</i> has given such a recommendation.⁠⸺⁠I’ll go see anybody, quoth my uncle <i>Toby</i>; for he was all compliance through every step of the journey⁠⸺⁠Defend me! said my father⁠—they are all mummies⁠⸺⁠Then one need not shave; quoth my uncle <i>Toby</i>⁠⸺⁠Shave! no⁠—cried my father⁠—’twill be more like relations to go with our beards on⁠—So out we sallied, the corporal lending his master his arm, and bringing up the rear, to the abby of Saint <i>Germain</i>.</p>
			<p>Everything is very fine, and very rich, and very superb, and very magnificent, said my father, addressing himself to the sacristan, who was a younger brother of the order of <i>Benedictines</i>⁠—but our curiosity has led us to see the bodies, of which Monsieur <i>Sequier</i> has given the world so exact a description.⁠—The sacristan made a bow, and lighting a torch first, which he had always in the vestry ready for the purpose; he led us into the tomb of <abbr>St.</abbr> <i>Heribald</i>⁠⸺⁠This, said the sacristan, laying his hand upon the tomb, was a renowned prince of the house of <i>Bavaria</i>, who under the successive reigns of <i>Charlemagne</i>, <i>Louis le Debonnair</i>, and <i>Charles the Bald</i>, bore a great sway in the government, and had a principal hand in bringing everything into order and discipline⁠⸺⁠</p>
			<p>Then he has been as great, said my uncle, in the field, as in the cabinet⁠⸺⁠I dare say he has been a gallant soldier⁠⸺⁠He was a monk⁠—said the sacristan.</p>
			<p>My uncle <i>Toby</i> and <i>Trim</i> sought comfort in each other’s faces⁠—but found it not: my father clapped both his hands upon his codpiece, which was a way he had when anything hugely tickled him: for though he hated a monk and the very smell of a monk worse than all the devils in hell⁠⸺⁠yet the shot hitting my uncle <i>Toby</i> and <i>Trim</i> so much harder than him, ’twas a relative triumph; and put him into the gayest humour in the world.</p>
			<p>⸺⁠And pray what do you call this gentleman? quoth my father, rather sportingly: This tomb, said the young <i>Benedictine</i>, looking downwards, contains the bones of Saint <b>Maxima</b>, who came from <i>Ravenna</i> on purpose to touch the body⁠⸺⁠</p>
			<p>⸺⁠Of Saint <b>Maximus</b>, said my father, popping in with his saint before him,⁠—they were two of the greatest saints in the whole martyrology, added my father⁠⸺⁠Excuse me, said the sacristan⁠⸺⸺’twas to touch the bones of Saint <i>Germain</i>, the builder of the abby⁠⸺⁠And what did she get by it? said my uncle <i>Toby</i>⁠⸺⁠What does any woman get by it? said my father⁠⸺⁠<b>Martyrdome</b>; replied the young <i>Benedictine</i>, making a bow down to the ground, and uttering the word with so humble but decisive a cadence, it disarmed my father for a moment. ’Tis supposed, continued the <i>Benedictine</i>, that <abbr>St.</abbr> <i>Maxima</i> has lain in this tomb four hundred years, and two hundred before her canonization⁠⸺’Tis but a slow rise, brother <i>Toby</i>, quoth my father, in this selfsame army of martyrs.⁠⸺⁠A desperate slow one, an’ please your honour, said <i>Trim</i>, unless one could purchase⁠⸺⁠I should rather sell out entirely, quoth my uncle <i>Toby</i>⁠⸺⁠I am pretty much of your opinion, brother <i>Toby</i>, said my father.</p>
			<p>⸺⁠Poor <abbr>St.</abbr> <i>Maxima!</i> said my uncle <i>Toby</i> low to himself, as we turn’d from her tomb: She was one of the fairest and most beautiful ladies either of <i>Italy</i> or <i>France</i>, continued the sacristan⁠⸺⁠But who the duce has got lain down here, besides her? quoth my father, pointing with his cane to a large tomb as we walked on⁠⸺⁠It is Saint <i>Optat</i>, Sir, answered the sacristan⁠⸺⁠And properly is Saint <i>Optat</i> plac’d! said my father: And what is Saint <i>Optat’s</i> story? continued he. Saint <i>Optat</i>, replied the sacristan, was a bishop⁠⸺⁠</p>
			<p>⸺⁠I thought so, by heaven! cried my father, interrupting him⁠⸺⁠Saint <i>Optat!</i>⁠⸺⁠how should Saint <i>Optat</i> fail? so snatching out his pocketbook, and the young <i>Benedictine</i> holding him the torch as he wrote, he set it down as a new prop to his system of Christian names, and I will be bold to say, so disinterested was he in the search of truth, that had he found a treasure in Saint <i>Optat’s</i> tomb, it would not have made him half so rich: ’Twas as successful a short visit as ever was paid to the dead; and so highly was his fancy pleas’d with all that had passed in it,⁠—that he determined at once to stay another day in <i>Auxerre</i>.</p>
			<p>—I’ll see the rest of these good gentry tomorrow, said my father, as we cross’d over the square⁠—And while you are paying that visit, brother <i>Shandy</i>, quoth my uncle <i>Toby</i>⁠—the corporal and I will mount the ramparts.</p>
