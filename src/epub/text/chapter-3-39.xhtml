			<p>There was not any one scene more entertaining in our family⁠—and to do it justice in this point;⁠⸺⁠and I here put off my cap and lay it upon the table close beside my ink-horn, on purpose to make my declaration to the world concerning this one article the more solemn⁠⸺⁠that I believe in my soul (unless my love and partiality to my understanding blinds me) the hand of the supreme Maker and first Designer of all things never made or put a family together (in that period at least of it which I have sat down to write the story of)⁠⸺⁠where the characters of it were cast or contrasted with so dramatick a felicity as ours was, for this end; or in which the capacities of affording such exquisite scenes, and the powers of shifting them perpetually from morning to night, were lodged and entrusted with so unlimited a confidence, as in the <b>Shandy Family</b>.</p>
			<p>Not any one of these was more diverting, I say, in this whimsical theatre of ours⁠⸺⁠than what frequently arose out of this selfsame chapter of long noses⁠⸻especially when my father’s imagination was heated with the enquiry, and nothing would serve him but to heat my uncle <i>Toby’s</i> too.</p>
			<p>My uncle <i>Toby</i> would give my father all possible fair play in this attempt; and with infinite patience would sit smoaking his pipe for whole hours together, whilst my father was practising upon his head, and trying every accessible avenue to drive <i>Prignitz</i> and <i>Scroderus’s</i> solutions into it.</p>
			<p>Whether they were above my uncle <i>Toby’s</i> reason⁠⸻or contrary to it⁠⸻or that his brain was like <em>damp</em> timber, and no spark could possibly take hold⁠⸺⁠or that it was so full of saps, mines, blinds, curtins, and such military disqualifications to his seeing clearly into <i>Prignitz</i> and <i>Scroderus’s</i> doctrines⁠⸺⁠I say not⁠—let schoolmen⁠—scullions, anatomists, and engineers, fight for it among themselves⁠⸺⁠</p>
			<p>’Twas some misfortune, I make no doubt, in this affair, that my father had every word of it to translate for the benefit of my uncle <i>Toby</i>, and render out of <i>Slawkenbergius’s</i> <em>Latin</em>, of which, as he was no great master, his translation was not always of the purest⁠⸺⁠and generally least so where ’twas most wanted.⁠—This naturally open’d a door to a second misfortune;⁠⸺⁠that in the warmer paroxysms of his zeal to open my uncle <i>Toby’s</i> eyes⁠⸻my father’s ideas ran on as much faster than the translation, as the translation outmoved my uncle <i>Toby’s</i>⁠⸻neither the one or the other added much to the perspicuity of my father’s lecture.</p>
