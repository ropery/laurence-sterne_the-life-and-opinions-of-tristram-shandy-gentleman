			<p>No matter how, or in what mood⁠—but I flew from the tomb of the lovers⁠—or rather I did not fly <em>from</em> it⁠—(for there was no such thing existing) and just got time enough to the boat to save my passage;⁠—and ere I had sailed a hundred yards, the <i>Rhône</i> and the <i>Saôn</i> met together, and carried me down merrily betwixt them.</p>
			<p>But I have described this voyage down the <i>Rhône</i>, before I made it⁠⸺⁠</p>
			<p>⸺⁠So now I am at <i>Avignon</i>, and as there is nothing to see but the old house, in which the duke of <i>Ormond</i> resided, and nothing to stop me but a short remark upon the place, in three minutes you will see me crossing the bridge upon a mule, with <i>François</i> upon a horse with my portmanteau behind him, and the owner of both, striding the way before us, with a long gun upon his shoulder, and a sword under his arm, lest peradventure we should run away with his cattle. Had you seen my breeches in entering <i>Avignon</i>,⁠⸺⁠Though you’d have seen them better, I think, as I mounted⁠—you would not have thought the precaution amiss, or found in your heart to have taken it in dudgeon; for my own part, I took it most kindly; and determined to make him a present of them, when we got to the end of our journey, for the trouble they had put him to, of arming himself at all points against them.</p>
			<p>Before I go further, let me get rid of my remark upon <i>Avignon</i>, which is this: That I think it wrong, merely because a man’s hat has been blown off his head by chance the first night he comes to <i>Avignon</i>,⁠⸺⁠that he should therefore say, “<i>Avignon</i> is more subject to high winds than any town in all <i>France</i>:” for which reason I laid no stress upon the accident till I had enquired of the master of the inn about it, who telling me seriously it was so⁠⸺⁠and hearing, moreover, the windiness of <i>Avignon</i> spoke of in the country about as a proverb⁠⸺⁠I set it down, merely to ask the learned what can be the cause⁠⸺⁠the consequence I saw⁠—for they are all Dukes, Marquisses, and Counts, there⁠⸺⁠the duce a Baron, in all <i>Avignon</i>⁠⸺⁠so that there is scarce any talking to them on a windy day.</p>
			<p>Prithee, friend, said I, take hold of my mule for a moment⁠⸺⁠for I wanted to pull off one of my jackboots, which hurt my heel⁠—the man was standing quite idle at the door of the inn, and as I had taken it into my head, he was someway concerned about the house or stable, I put the bridle into his hand⁠—so begun with the boot:⁠—when I had finished the affair, I turned about to take the mule from the man, and thank him⁠⸺⁠</p>
			<p>⸻But <i xml:lang="fr">Monsieur le Marquis</i> had walked in⁠⸺⁠</p>
