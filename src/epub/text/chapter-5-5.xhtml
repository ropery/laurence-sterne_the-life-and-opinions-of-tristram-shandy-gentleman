			<p>My mother was going very gingerly in the dark along the passage which led to the parlour, as my uncle <i>Toby</i> pronounced the word <em>wife</em>.⁠—’Tis a shrill penetrating sound of itself, and <i>Obadiah</i> had helped it by leaving the door a little ajar, so that my mother heard enough of it to imagine herself the subject of the conversation; so laying the edge of her finger across her two lips⁠—holding in her breath, and bending her head a little downwards, with a twist of her neck⁠—(not towards the door, but from it, by which means her ear was brought to the chink)⁠—she listened with all her powers:⁠⸺⁠the listening slave, with the Goddess of Silence at his back, could not have given a finer thought for an intaglio.</p>
			<p>In this attitude I am determined to let her stand for five minutes: till I bring up the affairs of the kitchen (as <i>Rapin</i> does those of the church) to the same period.</p>
