			<p>⸺⁠And the story too⁠—if you please: for though I have all along been hastening towards this part of it, with so much earnest desire, as well knowing it to be the choicest morsel of what I had to offer to the world, yet now that I am got to it, anyone is welcome to take my pen, and go on with the story for me that will⁠—I see the difficulties of the descriptions I’m going to give⁠—and feel my want of powers.</p>
			<p>It is one comfort at least to me, that I lost some fourscore ounces of blood this week in a most uncritical fever which attacked me at the beginning of this chapter; so that I have still some hopes remaining, it may be more in the serous or globular parts of the blood, than in the subtle <em>aura</em> of the brain⁠⸺⁠be it which it will⁠—an Invocation can do no hurt⁠⸺⁠and I leave the affair entirely to the <em>invoked</em>, to inspire or to inject me according as he sees good.</p>

				<h4 epub:type="title">The Invocation</h4>
				<p>Gentle Spirit of sweetest humour, who erst did sit upon the easy pen of my beloved <b>Cervantes</b>; Thou who glided’st daily through his lattice, and turned’st the twilight of his prison into noonday brightness by thy presence⁠⸺⁠tinged’st his little urn of water with heaven-sent nectar, and all the time he wrote of <i>Sancho</i> and his master, didst cast thy mystic mantle o’er his wither’d stump,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-38" id="noteref-38" epub:type="noteref">38</a> and wide extended it to all the evils of his life⁠⸻</p>
				<p>⸺⁠Turn in hither, I beseech thee!⁠⸺⁠behold these breeches!⁠⸺⁠they are all I have in the world⁠⸺⁠that piteous rent was given them at <i>Lyons</i>⁠⸻</p>
				<p>My shirts! see what a deadly schism has happen’d amongst ’em⁠—for the laps are in <i>Lombardy</i>, and the rest of ’em here⁠—I never had but six, and a cunning gypsey of a laundress at <i>Milan</i> cut me off the <em>fore</em>-laps of five⁠—To do her justice, she did it with some consideration⁠—for I was returning out of <i>Italy</i>.</p>
				<p>And yet, notwithstanding all this, and a pistol tinderbox which was moreover filch’d from me at <i>Sienna</i>, and twice that I pay’d five Pauls for two hard eggs, once at <i>Raddicoffini</i>, and a second time at <i>Capua</i>⁠—I do not think a journey through <i>France</i> and <i>Italy</i>, provided a man keeps his temper all the way, so bad a thing as some people would make you believe: there must be <em>ups</em> and <em>downs</em>, or how the duce should we get into vallies where Nature spreads so many tables of entertainment.⁠—’Tis nonsense to imagine they will lend you their voitures to be shaken to pieces for nothing; and unless you pay twelve sous for greasing your wheels, how should the poor peasant get butter to his bread?⁠—We really expect too much⁠—and for the livre or two above par for your suppers and bed⁠—at the most they are but one shilling and ninepence halfpenny⁠⸺⁠who would embroil their philosophy for it? for heaven’s and for your own sake, pay it⁠⸺⁠pay it with both hands open, rather than leave <i>Disappointment</i> sitting drooping upon the eye of your fair Hostess and her Damsels in the gateway, at your departure⁠⸺⁠and besides, my dear Sir, you get a sisterly kiss of each of ’em worth a pound⁠⸺⁠at least I did⁠⸺⁠</p>
				<p>⸺⁠For my uncle <i>Toby’s</i> amours running all the way in my head, they had the same effect upon me as if they had been my own⁠⸺⁠I was in the most perfect state of bounty and goodwill; and felt the kindliest harmony vibrating within me, with every oscillation of the chaise alike; so that whether the roads were rough or smooth, it made no difference; everything I saw or had to do with, touch’d upon some secret spring either of sentiment or rapture.</p>
				<p>⸺⁠They were the sweetest notes I ever heard; and I instantly let down the fore-glass to hear them more distinctly⁠⸺’Tis <i>Maria</i>; said the postillion, observing I was listening⁠⸺⁠Poor <i>Maria</i>, continued he (leaning his body on one side to let me see her, for he was in a line betwixt us), is sitting upon a bank playing her vespers upon her pipe, with her little goat beside her.</p>
				<p>The young fellow utter’d this with an accent and a look so perfectly in tune to a feeling heart, that I instantly made a vow, I would give him a four-and-twenty sous piece, when I got to <i>Moulins</i>⁠⸺⁠</p>
				<p>⸻And who is <em>poor</em> <i>Maria?</i> said I.</p>
				<p>The love and piety of all the villages around us; said the postillion⁠⸺⁠it is but three years ago, that the sun did not shine upon so fair, so quick-witted and amiable a maid; and better fate did <i>Maria</i> deserve, than to have her Banns forbid, by the intrigues of the curate of the parish who published them⁠⸺⁠</p>
				<p>He was going on, when <i>Maria</i>, who had made a short pause, put the pipe to her mouth, and began the air again⁠⸺⁠they were the same notes;⁠⸺⁠yet were ten times sweeter: It is the evening service to the Virgin, said the young man⁠⸺⁠but who has taught her to play it⁠—or how she came by her pipe, no one knows; we think that heaven has assisted her in both; for ever since she has been unsettled in her mind, it seems her only consolation⁠⸺⁠she has never once had the pipe out of her hand, but plays that <em>service</em> upon it almost night and day.</p>
				<p>The postillion delivered this with so much discretion and natural eloquence, that I could not help deciphering something in his face above his condition, and should have sifted out his history, had not poor <i>Maria</i> taken such full possession of me.</p>
				<p>We had got up by this time almost to the bank where <i>Maria</i> was sitting: she was in a thin white jacket, with her hair, all but two tresses, drawn up into a silk-net, with a few olive leaves twisted a little fantastically on one side⁠⸺⁠she was beautiful; and if ever I felt the full force of an honest heartache, it was the moment I saw her⁠⸺⁠</p>
				<p>⸺⁠God help her! poor damsel! above a hundred masses, said the postillion, have been said in the several parish churches and convents around, for her,⁠⸺⁠but without effect; we have still hopes, as she is sensible for short intervals, that the Virgin at last will restore her to herself; but her parents, who know her best, are hopeless upon that score, and think her senses are lost forever.</p>
				<p>As the postillion spoke this, <b>Maria</b> made a cadence so melancholy, so tender and querulous, that I sprung out of the chaise to help her, and found myself sitting betwixt her and her goat before I relapsed from my enthusiasm.</p>
				<p><b>Maria</b> look’d wistfully for some time at me, and then at her goat⁠⸺⁠and then at me⁠⸺⁠and then at her goat again, and so on, alternately⁠⸺⁠</p>
				<p>⸺⁠Well, <i>Maria</i>, said I softly⁠⸺⁠What resemblance do you find?</p>
				<p>I do entreat the candid reader to believe me, that it was from the humblest conviction of what a <i>Beast</i> man is,⁠⸺⁠that I asked the question; and that I would not have let fallen an unseasonable pleasantry in the venerable presence of Misery, to be entitled to all the wit that ever <i>Rabelais</i> scatter’d⁠⸺⁠and yet I own my heart smote me, and that I so smarted at the very idea of it, that I swore I would set up for Wisdom, and utter grave sentences the rest of my days⁠⸺⁠and never⁠⸺⁠never attempt again to commit mirth with man, woman, or child, the longest day I had to live.</p>
				<p>As for writing nonsense to them⁠⸺⁠I believe, there was a reserve⁠—but that I leave to the world.</p>
				<p>Adieu, <i>Maria!</i>⁠—adieu, poor hapless damsel!⁠⸺⁠some time, but not <em>now</em>, I may hear thy sorrows from thy own lips⁠⸺⁠but I was deceived; for that moment she took her pipe and told me such a tale of woe with it, that I rose up, and with broken and irregular steps walk’d softly to my chaise.</p>
				<p>⸻What an excellent inn at <i>Moulins!</i></p>
