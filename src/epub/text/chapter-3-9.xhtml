			<p>Great wits jump: for the moment <abbr>Dr.</abbr> <i>Slop</i> cast his eyes upon his bag (which he had not done till the dispute with my uncle <i>Toby</i> about midwifery put him in mind of it)⁠—the very same thought occurred.⁠—’Tis God’s mercy, quoth he (to himself) that <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> <i>Shandy</i> has had so bad a time of it,⁠⸺⁠else she might have been brought to bed seven times told, before one half of these knots could have got untied.⁠⸺⁠But here you must distinguish⁠—the thought floated only in <abbr>Dr.</abbr> <i>Slop’s</i> mind, without sail or ballast to it, as a simple proposition; millions of which, as your worship knows, are every day swimming quietly in the middle of the thin juice of a man’s understanding, without being carried backwards or forwards, till some little gusts of passion or interest drive them to one side.</p>
			<p>A sudden trampling in the room above, near my mother’s bed, did the proposition the very service I am speaking of. By all that’s unfortunate, quoth <abbr>Dr.</abbr> <i>Slop</i>, unless I make haste, the thing will actually befall me as it is.</p>
