			<p>On the fifth day of <i>November</i>, 1718, which to the æra fixed on, was as near nine calendar months as any husband could in reason have expected,⁠—was I <i>Tristram Shandy</i>, Gentleman, brought forth into this scurvy and disasterous world of ours.⁠⸺⁠I wish I had been born in the Moon, or in any of the planets (except <i>Jupiter</i> or <i>Saturn</i>, because I never could bear cold weather) for it could not well have fared worse with me in any of them (though I will not answer for <i>Venus</i>) than it has in this vile, dirty planet of ours,⁠—which, o’ my conscience, with reverence be it spoken, I take to be made up of the shreds and clippings of the rest;⁠⸺⁠not but the planet is well enough, provided a man could be born in it to a great title or to a great estate; or could anyhow contrive to be called up to publick charges, and employments of dignity or power;⁠⸺⁠but that is not my case;⁠⸺⁠and therefore every man will speak of the fair as his own market has gone in it;⁠⸻for which cause I affirm it over again to be one of the vilest worlds that ever was made;⁠—for I can truly say, that from the first hour I drew my breath in it, to this, that I can now scarce draw it at all, for an asthma I got in scating against the wind in <i>Flanders</i>;⁠—I have been the continual sport of what the world calls Fortune; and though I will not wrong her by saying, She has ever made me feel the weight of any great or signal evil;⁠⸺⁠yet with all the good temper in the world, I affirm it of her, that in every stage of my life, and at every turn and corner where she could get fairly at me, the ungracious duchess has pelted me with a set of as pitiful misadventures and cross accidents as ever small <b>Hero</b> sustained.</p>
