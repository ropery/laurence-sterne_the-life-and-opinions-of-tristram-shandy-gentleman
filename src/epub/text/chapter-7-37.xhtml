			<p>When the first transport was over, and the registers of the brain were beginning to get a little out of the confusion into which this jumble of cross accidents had cast them⁠—it then presently occurr’d to me, that I had left my remarks in the pocket of the chaise⁠—and that in selling my chaise, I had sold my remarks along with it, to the chaise-vamper. I leave this void space that the reader may swear into it any oath that he is most accustomed to⁠⸺⁠For my own part, if ever I swore a <em>whole</em> oath into a vacancy in my life, I think it was into that⁠⸺*********, said I⁠—and so my remarks through <i>France</i>, which were as full of wit, as an egg is full of meat, and as well worth four hundred guineas, as the said egg is worth a penny⁠—have I been selling here to a chaise-vamper⁠—for four <i>Louis d’Ors</i>⁠—and giving him a post-chaise (by heaven) worth six into the bargain; had it been to <i>Dodsley</i>, or <i>Becket</i>, or any creditable bookseller, who was either leaving off business, and wanted a post-chaise⁠—or who was beginning it⁠—and wanted my remarks, and two or three guineas along with them⁠—I could have borne it⁠⸺⁠but to a chaise-vamper!⁠—show me to him this moment, <i>François</i>,⁠—said I⁠—The valet de place put on his hat, and led the way⁠—and I pull’d off mine, as I pass’d the commissary, and followed him.</p>
