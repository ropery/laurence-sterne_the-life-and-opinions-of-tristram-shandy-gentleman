			<p>Though the corporal had been as good as his word in putting my uncle <i>Toby’s</i> great ramallie-wig into pipes, yet the time was too short to produce any great effects from it: it had lain many years squeezed up in the corner of his old campaign trunk; and as bad forms are not so easy to be got the better of, and the use of candle-ends not so well understood, it was not so pliable a business as one would have wished. The corporal with cheery eye and both arms extended, had fallen back perpendicular from it a score times, to inspire it, if possible, with a better air⁠⸺⁠had <strong>spleen</strong> given a look at it, ’twould have cost her ladyship a smile⁠⸺⁠it curl’d everywhere but where the corporal would have it; and where a buckle or two, in his opinion, would have done it honour, he could as soon have raised the dead.</p>
			<p>Such it was⁠⸺⁠or rather such would it have seem’d upon any other brow; but the sweet look of goodness which sat upon my uncle <i>Toby’s</i>, assimilated everything around it so sovereignly to itself, and Nature had moreover wrote <b>Gentleman</b> with so fair a hand in every line of his countenance, that even his tarnish’d gold-laced hat and huge cockade of flimsy taffeta became him; and though not worth a button in themselves, yet the moment my uncle <i>Toby</i> put them on, they became serious objects, and altogether seem’d to have been picked up by the hand of Science to set him off to advantage.</p>
			<p>Nothing in this world could have cooperated more powerfully towards this, than my uncle <i>Toby’s</i> blue and gold⁠⸺⁠<em>had not Quantity in some measure been necessary to Grace</em>: in a period of fifteen or sixteen years since they had been made, by a total inactivity in my uncle <i>Toby’s</i> life, for he seldom went further than the bowling-green⁠—his blue and gold had become so miserably too strait for him, that it was with the utmost difficulty the corporal was able to get him into them; the taking them up at the sleeves, was of no advantage.⁠⸺⁠They were laced however down the back, and at the seams of the sides, <abbr>etc.</abbr>, in the mode of King <i>William’s</i> reign; and to shorten all description, they shone so bright against the sun that morning, and had so metallick and doughty an air with them, that had my uncle <i>Toby</i> thought of attacking in armour, nothing could have so well imposed upon his imagination.</p>
			<p>As for the thin scarlet breeches, they had been unripp’d by the tailor between the legs, and left at <em>sixes and sevens</em>⁠⸺⁠</p>
			<p>⸺⁠Yes, Madam,⁠⸺⁠but let us govern our fancies. It is enough they were held impracticable the night before, and as there was no alternative in my uncle <i>Toby’s</i> wardrobe, he sallied forth in the red plush.</p>
			<p>The corporal had array’d himself in poor <i>Le Fever’s</i> regimental coat; and with his hair tuck’d up under his <i>Montero</i>-cap, which he had furbish’d up for the occasion, march’d three paces distant from his master: a whiff of military pride had puff’d out his shirt at the wrist; and upon that in a black leather thong clipp’d into a tassel beyond the knot, hung the corporal’s stick⁠⸺⁠My uncle <i>Toby</i> carried his cane like a pike.</p>
			<p>⸺⁠It looks well at least; quoth my father to himself.</p>
