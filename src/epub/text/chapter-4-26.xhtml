			<p>⸺⁠See if he is not cutting it into slips, and giving them about him to light their pipes!⁠⸺’Tis abominable, answered <i>Didius</i>; it should not go unnoticed, said doctor <i>Kysarcius</i>⁠⸻☞ he was of the <i>Kysarcii</i> of the Low Countries.</p>
			<p>Methinks, said <i>Didius</i>, half rising from his chair, in order to remove a bottle and a tall decanter, which stood in a direct line betwixt him and <i>Yorick</i>⁠⸺⁠you might have spared this sarcastic stroke, and have hit upon a more proper place, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> <i>Yorick</i>⁠—or at least upon a more proper occasion to have shown your contempt of what we have been about: If the sermon is of no better worth than to light pipes with⁠⸺’twas certainly, Sir, not good enough to be preached before so learned a body; and if ’twas good enough to be preached before so learned a body⁠⸺’twas certainly, Sir, too good to light their pipes with afterwards.</p>
			<p>⸺⁠I have got him fast hung up, quoth <i>Didius</i> to himself, upon one of the two horns of my dilemma⁠⸺⁠let him get off as he can.</p>
			<p>I have undergone such unspeakable torments, in bringing forth this sermon, quoth <i>Yorick</i>, upon this occasion⁠⸻that I declare, <i>Didius</i>, I would suffer martyrdom⁠—and if it was possible my horse with me, a thousand times over, before I would sit down and make such another: I was delivered of it at the wrong end of me⁠⸺⁠it came from my head instead of my heart⁠⸻and it is for the pain it gave me, both in the writing and preaching of it, that I revenge myself of it, in this manner⁠—To preach, to show the extent of our reading, or the subtleties of our wit⁠—to parade in the eyes of the vulgar with the beggarly accounts of a little learning, tinsel’d over with a few words which glitter, but convey little light and less warmth⁠⸺⁠is a dishonest use of the poor single half hour in a week which is put into our hands⁠—’Tis not preaching the gospel⁠—but ourselves⁠⸺⁠For my own part, continued <i>Yorick</i>, I had rather direct five words point-blank to the heart.⁠—</p>
			<p>As <i>Yorick</i> pronounced the word <em>point-blank</em>, my uncle <i>Toby</i> rose up to say something upon projectiles⁠⸺⁠when a single word and no more uttered from the opposite side of the table drew everyone’s ears towards it⁠—a word of all others in the dictionary the last in that place to be expected⁠—a word I am ashamed to write⁠—yet must be written⁠⸺⁠must be read⁠—illegal⁠—uncanonical⁠—guess ten thousand guesses, multiplied into themselves⁠—rack⁠—torture your invention forever, you’re where you was⁠⸺⸺⁠In short, I’ll tell it in the next chapter.</p>
