			<p>As the ancients agree, brother <i>Toby</i>, said my father, that there are two different and distinct kinds of <em>love</em>, according to the different parts which are affected by it⁠—the Brain or Liver⁠⸺⁠I think when a man is in love, it behoves him a little to consider which of the two he is fallen into.</p>
			<p>What signifies it, brother <i>Shandy</i>, replied my uncle <i>Toby</i>, which of the two it is, provided it will but make a man marry, and love his wife, and get a few children?</p>
			<p>⸺⁠A few children! cried my father, rising out of his chair, and looking full in my mother’s face, as he forced his way betwixt her’s and doctor <i>Slop’s</i>⁠—a few children! cried my father, repeating my uncle <i>Toby’s</i> words as he walk’d to and fro⁠⸺⁠</p>
			<p>⸺⁠Not, my dear brother <i>Toby</i>, cried my father, recovering himself all at once, and coming close up to the back of my uncle <i>Toby’s</i> chair⁠—not that I should be sorry hadst thou a score⁠—on the contrary, I should rejoice⁠—and be as kind, <i>Toby</i>, to every one of them as a father⁠—</p>
			<p>My uncle <i>Toby</i> stole his hand unperceived behind his chair, to give my father’s a squeeze⁠⸺⁠</p>
			<p>⸺⁠Nay, moreover, continued he, keeping hold of my uncle <i>Toby’s</i> hand⁠—so much dost thou possess, my dear <i>Toby</i>, of the milk of human nature, and so little of its asperities⁠—’tis piteous the world is not peopled by creatures which resemble thee; and was I an <i>Asiatic</i> monarch, added my father, heating himself with his new project⁠—I would oblige thee, provided it would not impair thy strength⁠—or dry up thy radical moisture too fast⁠—or weaken thy memory or fancy, brother <i>Toby</i>, which these gymnics inordinately taken are apt to do⁠—else, dear <i>Toby</i>, I would procure thee the most beautiful women in my empire, and I would oblige thee, nolens, volens, to beget for me one subject every <em>month</em>⁠⸺⁠</p>
			<p>As my father pronounced the last word of the sentence⁠—my mother took a pinch of snuff.</p>
			<p>Now I would not, quoth my uncle <i>Toby</i>, get a child, nolens, volens, that is, whether I would or no, to please the greatest prince upon earth⁠⸺⁠</p>
			<p>⸺⁠And ’twould be cruel in me, brother <i>Toby</i>, to compel thee; said my father⁠—but ’tis a case put to show thee, that it is not thy begetting a child⁠—in case thou should’st be able⁠—but the system of Love and Marriage thou goest upon, which I would set thee right in⁠⸺⁠</p>
			<p>There is at least, said <i>Yorick</i>, a great deal of reason and plain sense in captain <i>Shandy’s</i> opinion of love; and ’tis amongst the ill-spent hours of my life, which I have to answer for, that I have read so many flourishing poets and rhetoricians in my time, from whom I never could extract so much⁠⸺⁠</p>
			<p>I wish, <i>Yorick</i>, said my father, you had read <i>Plato</i>; for there you would have learnt that there are two <b>Loves</b>⁠—I know there were two <b>Religions</b>, replied <i>Yorick</i>, amongst the ancients⁠⸺⁠one⁠—for the vulgar, and another for the learned;⁠—but I think <b>one Love</b> might have served both of them very well⁠—</p>
			<p>It could not; replied my father⁠—and for the same reasons: for of these Loves, according to <i>Ficinus’s</i> comment upon <i>Velasius</i>, the one is rational⁠⸺⁠</p>
			<p>⸺⁠the other is <em>natural</em>⁠⸺⁠</p>
			<p>the first ancient⁠⸺⁠without mother⁠⸺⁠where <i>Venus</i> had nothing to do: the second, begotten of <i>Jupiter</i> and <i>Dione</i>⁠—</p>
			<p>⸺⁠Pray, brother, quoth my uncle <i>Toby</i>, what has a man who believes in God to do with this? My father could not stop to answer, for fear of breaking the thread of his discourse⁠⸺⁠</p>
			<p>This latter, continued he, partakes wholly of the nature of <i>Venus</i>.</p>
			<p>The first, which is the golden chain let down from heaven, excites to love heroic, which comprehends in it, and excites to the desire of philosophy and truth⁠⸺⁠the second, excites to <em>desire</em>, simply⁠⸺⁠</p>
			<p>⸺⁠I think the procreation of children as beneficial to the world, said <i>Yorick</i>, as the finding out of the longitude⁠⸺⁠</p>
			<p>⸺⁠To be sure, said my mother, <em>love</em> keeps peace in the world⁠⸺⁠</p>
			<p>⸺⁠In the <em>house</em>⁠—my dear, I own⁠—</p>
			<p>⸺⁠It replenishes the earth; said my mother⁠⸺⁠</p>
			<p>But it keeps heaven empty⁠—my dear; replied my father.</p>
			<p>⸺’Tis Virginity, cried <i>Slop</i>, triumphantly, which fills paradise.</p>
			<p>Well push’d, nun! quoth my father.</p>
