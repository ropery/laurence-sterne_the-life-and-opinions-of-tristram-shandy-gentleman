			<p>It is a great pity⁠⸺⁠but ’tis certain from every day’s observation of man, that he may be set on fire like a candle, at either end⁠—provided there is a sufficient wick standing out; if there is not⁠—there’s an end of the affair; and if there is⁠—by lighting it at the bottom, as the flame in that case has the misfortune generally to put out itself⁠—there’s an end of the affair again.</p>
			<p>For my part, could I always have the ordering of it which way I would be burnt myself⁠—for I cannot bear the thoughts of being burnt like a beast⁠—I would oblige a housewife constantly to light me at the top; for then I should burn down decently to the socket; that is, from my head to my heart, from my heart to my liver, from my liver to my bowels, and so on by the meseraick veins and arteries, through all the turns and lateral insertions of the intestines and their tunicles to the blind gut⁠⸺⁠</p>
			<p>⸺⁠I beseech you, doctor <i>Slop</i>, quoth my uncle <i>Toby</i>, interrupting him as he mentioned the <em>blind gut</em>, in a discourse with my father the night my mother was brought to bed of me⁠⸺⁠I beseech you, quoth my uncle <i>Toby</i>, to tell me which is the blind gut; for, old as I am, I vow I do not know to this day where it lies.</p>
			<p>The <em>blind gut</em>, answered doctor <i>Slop</i>, lies betwixt the <i>Ilion</i> and <i>Colon</i>⁠⸺⁠</p>
			<p>In a man? said my father.</p>
			<p>⸺’Tis precisely the same, cried doctor <i>Slop</i>, in a woman.⁠⸺⁠</p>
			<p>That’s more than I know; quoth my father.</p>
