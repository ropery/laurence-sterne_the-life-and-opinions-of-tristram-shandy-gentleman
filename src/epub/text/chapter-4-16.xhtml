			<p>If my wife will but venture him⁠—brother <i>Toby</i>, <i>Trismegistus</i> shall be dress’d and brought down to us, whilst you and I are getting our breakfasts together.⁠⸻</p>
			<p>⸺⁠Go, tell <i>Susannah</i>, <i>Obadiah</i>, to step here.</p>
			<p>She is run upstairs, answered <i>Obadiah</i>, this very instant, sobbing and crying, and wringing her hands as if her heart would break.</p>
			<p>We shall have a rare month of it, said my father, turning his head from <i>Obadiah</i>, and looking wistfully in my uncle <i>Toby’s</i> face for some time⁠—we shall have a devilish month of it, brother <i>Toby</i>, said my father, setting his arms akimbo, and shaking his head; fire, water, women, wind⁠—brother <i>Toby!</i>⁠—’Tis some misfortune, quoth my uncle <i>Toby</i>.⁠⸺⁠That it is, cried my father⁠—to have so many jarring elements breaking loose, and riding triumph in every corner of a gentleman’s house⁠—Little boots it to the peace of a family, brother <i>Toby</i>, that you and I possess ourselves, and sit here silent and unmoved⁠⸺⁠whilst such a storm is whistling over our heads.⁠⸻</p>
			<p>And what’s the matter, <i>Susannah?</i> They have called the child <i>Tristram</i>⁠⸺⁠and my mistress is just got out of an hysterick fit about it⁠⸺⁠No⁠⸺’tis not my fault, said <i>Susannah</i>⁠—I told him it was <i>Tristram-gistus</i>.</p>
			<p>⸺⁠Make tea for yourself, brother <i>Toby</i>, said my father, taking down his hat⁠⸺⁠but how different from the sallies and agitations of voice and members which a common reader would imagine!</p>
			<p>—For he spake in the sweetest modulation⁠—and took down his hat with the genteelest movement of limbs, that ever affliction harmonized and attuned together.</p>
			<p>⸺⁠Go to the bowling-green for corporal <i>Trim</i>, said my uncle <i>Toby</i>, speaking to <i>Obadiah</i>, as soon as my father left the room.</p>
