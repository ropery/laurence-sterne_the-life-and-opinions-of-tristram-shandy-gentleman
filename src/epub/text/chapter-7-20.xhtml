			<p>Now I hate to hear a person, especially if he be a traveller, complain that we do not get on so fast in <i>France</i> as we do in <i>England</i>; whereas we get on much faster, <i xml:lang="la">consideratis considerandis</i>; thereby always meaning, that if you weigh their vehicles with the mountains of baggage which you lay both before and behind upon them⁠—and then consider their puny horses, with the very little they give them⁠—’tis a wonder they get on at all: their suffering is most unchristian, and ’tis evident thereupon to me, that a <i>French</i> post-horse would not know what in the world to do, was it not for the two words ****** and ****** in which there is as much sustenance, as if you gave him a peck of corn: now as these words cost nothing, I long from my soul to tell the reader what they are; but here is the question⁠—they must be told him plainly, and with the most distinct articulation, or it will answer no end⁠—and yet to do it in that plain way⁠—though their reverences may laugh at it in the bedchamber⁠—fell well I wot, they will abuse it in the parlour: for which cause, I have been volving and revolving in my fancy some time, but to no purpose, by what clean device or facette contrivance I might so modulate them, that whilst I satisfy <em>that ear</em> which the reader chooses to <em>lend</em> me⁠—I might not dissatisfy the other which he keeps to himself.</p>
			<p>⸺⁠My ink burns my finger to try⁠⸺⁠and when I have⁠⸺’twill have a worse consequence⁠⸺⁠it will burn (I fear) my paper.</p>
			<p>⸺⁠No;⁠⸺⁠I dare not⁠⸺⁠</p>
			<p>But if you wish to know how the <em>abbess</em> of <i>Andoüillets</i> and a novice of her convent got over the difficulty (only first wishing myself all imaginable success)⁠—I’ll tell you without the least scruple.</p>
