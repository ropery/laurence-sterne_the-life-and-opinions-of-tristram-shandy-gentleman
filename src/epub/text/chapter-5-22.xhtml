			<p>King <i>William</i>, said my uncle <i>Toby</i>, addressing himself to <i>Yorick</i>, was so terribly provoked at count <i>Solmes</i> for disobeying his orders, that he would not suffer him to come into his presence for many months after.⁠⸺⁠I fear, answered <i>Yorick</i>, the squire will be as much provoked at the corporal, as the King at the count.⁠⸺⁠But ’twould be singularly hard in this case, continued he, if corporal <i>Trim</i>, who has behaved so diametrically opposite to count <i>Solmes</i>, should have the fate to be rewarded with the same disgrace:⁠⸺⁠too oft in this world, do things take that train.⁠⸺⁠I would spring a mine, cried my uncle <i>Toby</i>, rising up,⁠⸺⁠and blow up my fortifications, and my house with them, and we would perish under their ruins, ere I would stand by and see it.⁠⸺⁠<i>Trim</i> directed a slight,⁠⸺⁠but a grateful bow towards his master,⁠⸺⁠and so the chapter ends.</p>
