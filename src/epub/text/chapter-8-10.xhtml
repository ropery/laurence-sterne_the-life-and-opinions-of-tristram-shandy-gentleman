			<p>My uncle <i>Toby’s</i> head at that time was full of other matters, so that it was not till the demolition of <i>Dunkirk</i>, when all the other civilities of <i>Europe</i> were settled, that he found leisure to return this.</p>
			<p>This made an armistice (that is, speaking with regard to my uncle <i>Toby</i>⁠—but with respect to <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> <i>Wadman</i>, a vacancy)⁠—of almost eleven years. But in all cases of this nature, as it is the second blow, happen at what distance of time it will, which makes the fray⁠⸺⁠I choose for that reason to call these the amours of my uncle <i>Toby</i> with <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> <i>Wadman</i>, rather than the amours of <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> <i>Wadman</i> with my uncle <i>Toby</i>.</p>
			<p>This is not a distinction without a difference.</p>
			<p>It is not like the affair of <em>an old hat cock’d</em>⁠⸺⁠and <em>a cock’d old hat</em>, about which your reverences have so often been at odds with one another⁠⸺⁠but there is a difference here in the nature of things⁠⸺⁠</p>
			<p>And let me tell you, gentry, a wide one too.</p>
