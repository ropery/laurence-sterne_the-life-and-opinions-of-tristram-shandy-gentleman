			<p>⸺⁠What a conjecture was here lost!⁠⸺⁠My father in one of his best explanatory moods⁠—in eager pursuit of a metaphysical point into the very regions, where clouds and thick darkness would soon have encompassed it about;⁠—my uncle <i>Toby</i> in one of the finest dispositions for it in the world;⁠—his head like a smoak-jack;⁠⸺⁠the funnel unswept, and the ideas whirling round and round about in it, all obfuscated and darkened over with fuliginous matter!⁠—By the tombstone of <i>Lucian</i>⁠⸺⁠if it is in being⁠⸺⁠if not, why then by his ashes! by the ashes of my dear <i>Rabelais</i>, and dearer <i>Cervantes!</i>⁠⸻my father and my uncle <i>Toby’s</i> discourse upon <strong>time</strong> and <strong>eternity</strong>⁠⸺⁠was a discourse devoutly to be wished for! and the petulancy of my father’s humour, in putting a stop to it as he did, was a robbery of the <em>Ontologic Treasury</em> of such a jewel, as no coalition of great occasions and great men are ever likely to restore to it again.</p>
