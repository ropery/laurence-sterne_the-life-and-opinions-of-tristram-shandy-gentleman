			<p>My father took a single turn across the room, then sat down, and finished the chapter.</p>
			<p>The verbs auxiliary we are concerned in here, continued my father, are, <i>am</i>; <i>was</i>; <i>have</i>; <i>had</i>; <i>do</i>; <i>did</i>; <i>make</i>; <i>made</i>; <i>suffer</i>; <i>shall</i>; <i>should</i>; <i>will</i>; <i>would</i>; <i>can</i>; <i>could</i>; <i>owe</i>; <i>ought</i>; <i>used</i>; or <i>is wont</i>.⁠—And these varied with tenses, <i>present</i>, <i>past</i>, <i>future</i>, and conjugated with the verb <i>see</i>,⁠—or with these questions added to them;⁠—<i>Is it? Was it? Will it be? Would it be? May it be? Might it be?</i> And these again put negatively, <i>Is it not? Was it not? Ought it not?</i>⁠—Or affirmatively,⁠—<i>It is</i>; <i>It was</i>; <i>It ought to be</i>. Or chronologically,⁠—<i>Has it been always? Lately? How long ago?</i>⁠—Or hypothetically,⁠—<i>If it was? If it was not?</i> What would follow?⁠⸺⁠If the <i>French</i> should beat the <i>English?</i> If the <i>Sun</i> go out of the <i>Zodiac?</i></p>
			<p>Now, by the right use and application of these, continued my father, in which a child’s memory should be exercised, there is no one idea can enter his brain, how barren soever, but a magazine of conceptions and conclusions may be drawn forth from it.⁠⸺⁠Didst thou ever see a white bear? cried my father, turning his head round to <i>Trim</i>, who stood at the back of his chair:⁠—No, an’ please your honour, replied the corporal.⁠⸺⁠But thou couldst discourse about one, <i>Trim</i>, said my father, in case of need?⁠—How is it possible, brother, quoth my uncle <i>Toby</i>, if the corporal never saw one?⁠⸺’Tis the fact I want, replied my father,⁠—and the possibility of it is as follows.</p>
			<p><b>A white bear!</b> Very well. Have I ever seen one? Might I ever have seen one? Am I ever to see one? Ought I ever to have seen one? Or can I ever see one?</p>
			<p>Would I had seen a white bear! (for how can I imagine it?)</p>
			<p>If I should see a white bear, what would I say? If I should never see a white bear, what then?</p>
			<p>If I never have, can, must, or shall see a white bear alive; have I ever seen the skin of one? Did I ever see one painted?⁠—described? Have I never dreamed of one?</p>
			<p>Did my father, mother, uncle, aunt, brothers or sisters, ever see a white bear? What would they give? How would they behave? How would the white bear have behaved? Is he wild? Tame? Terrible? Rough? Smooth?</p>
			<p>—Is the white bear worth seeing?⁠—</p>
			<p>—Is there no sin in it?⁠—</p>
			<p>Is it better than a <strong>black one</strong>?</p>
