			<p>It was not an easy matter in any king’s reign (unless you were as lean a subject as myself) to have forced your hand diagonally, quite across your whole body, so as to gain the bottom of your opposite coat pocket.⁠⸺⁠In the year one thousand seven hundred and eighteen, when this happened, it was extremely difficult; so that when my uncle <i>Toby</i> discovered the transverse zig-zaggery of my father’s approaches towards it, it instantly brought into his mind those he had done duty in, before the gate of <i><abbr>St.</abbr> Nicolas</i>;⁠⸺⁠the idea of which drew off his attention so entirely from the subject in debate, that he had got his right hand to the bell to ring up <i>Trim</i> to go and fetch his map of <i>Namur</i>, and his compasses and sector along with it, to measure the returning angles of the traverses of that attack,⁠—but particularly of that one, where he received his wound upon his groin.</p>
			<p>My father knit his brows, and as he knit them, all the blood in his body seemed to rush up into his face⁠⸺⁠my uncle <i>Toby</i> dismounted immediately.</p>
			<p>⸺⁠I did not apprehend your uncle <i>Toby</i> was o’ horseback.⁠⸻</p>
