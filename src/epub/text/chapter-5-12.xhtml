			<p>⸺⁠But to return to my mother.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>My uncle <i>Toby’s</i> opinion, Madam, “that there could be no harm in <i>Cornelius Gallus</i>, the <i>Roman</i> prætor’s lying with his wife;”⁠⸺⁠or rather the last word of that opinion,⁠—(for it was all my mother heard of it) caught hold of her by the weak part of the whole sex:⁠⸺⁠You shall not mistake me,⁠—I mean her curiosity,⁠—she instantly concluded herself the subject of the conversation, and with that prepossession upon her fancy, you will readily conceive every word my father said, was accommodated either to herself, or her family concerns.</p>
			<p>⸺⁠Pray, Madam, in what street does the lady live, who would not have done the same?</p>
			<p>From the strange mode of <i>Cornelius’s</i> death, my father had made a transition to that of <i>Socrates</i>, and was giving my uncle <i>Toby</i> an abstract of his pleading before his judges;⁠⸺’twas irresistible:⁠⸺⁠not the oration of <i>Socrates</i>,⁠—but my father’s temptation to it.⁠⸺⁠He had wrote the Life of <i>Socrates</i><a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-21" id="noteref-21" epub:type="noteref">21</a> himself the year before he left off trade, which, I fear, was the means of hastening him out of it;⁠⸺⁠so that no one was able to set out with so full a sail, and in so swelling a tide of heroic loftiness upon the occasion, as my father was. Not a period in <i>Socrates’s</i> oration, which closed with a shorter word than <em>transmigration</em>, or <em>annihilation</em>,⁠—or a worse thought in the middle of it than <em>to be⁠—or not to be</em>,⁠—the entering upon a new and untried state of things,⁠—or, upon a long, a profound and peaceful sleep, without dreams, without disturbance?⁠⸺⁠<em>That we and our children were born to die,⁠—but neither of us born to be slaves</em>.⁠⸺⁠No⁠—there I mistake; that was part of <i>Eleazer’s</i> oration, as recorded by <i>Josephus</i> (<i xml:lang="la">de Bell. Judaic.</i>)⁠⸺⁠<i>Eleazer</i> owns he had it from the philosophers of <i>India</i>; in all likelihood <i>Alexander</i> the Great, in his irruption into <i>India</i>, after he had overrun <i>Persia</i>, amongst the many things he stole,⁠—stole that sentiment also; by which means it was carried, if not all the way by himself (for we all know he died at <i>Babylon</i>), at least by some of his maroders, into <i>Greece</i>,⁠—from <i>Greece</i> it got to <i>Rome</i>,⁠—from <i>Rome</i> to <i>France</i>,⁠—and from <i>France</i> to <i>England</i>:⁠⸺⁠So things come round.⁠⸺⁠</p>
			<p>By land carriage, I can conceive no other way.⁠⸺⁠</p>
			<p>By water the sentiment might easily have come down the <i>Ganges</i> into the <i>Sinus Gangeticus</i>, or <i>Bay of Bengal</i>, and so into the <i>Indian Sea</i>; and following the course of trade (the way from <i>India</i> by the <i>Cape of Good Hope</i> being then unknown), might be carried with other drugs and spices up the <i>Red Sea</i> to <i>Joddah</i>, the port of <i>Mekka</i>, or else to <i>Tor</i> or <i>Sues</i>, towns at the bottom of the gulf; and from thence by karrawans to <i>Coptos</i>, but three days’ journey distant, so down the <i>Nile</i> directly to <i>Alexandria</i>, where the <strong>sentiment</strong> would be landed at the very foot of the great staircase of the <i>Alexandrian</i> library,⁠⸺⁠and from that storehouse it would be fetched.⁠⸻Bless me! what a trade was driven by the learned in those days!</p>
