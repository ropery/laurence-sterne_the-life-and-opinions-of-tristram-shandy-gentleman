			<p>⸺⁠But ’tis no marvel, continued the corporal⁠—seeing my uncle <i>Toby</i> musing upon it⁠—for Love, an’ please your honour, is exactly like war, in this; that a soldier, though he has escaped three weeks complete o’ <i>Saturday</i> night,⁠—may nevertheless be shot through his heart on <i>Sunday</i> morning⁠⸺⁠<em>It happened so here</em>, an’ please your honour, with this difference only⁠—that it was on <i>Sunday</i> in the afternoon, when I fell in love all at once with a sisserara⁠⸺⁠It burst upon me, an’ please your honour, like a bomb⁠⸺⁠scarce giving me time to say, “God bless me.”</p>
			<p>I thought, <i>Trim</i>, said my uncle <i>Toby</i>, a man never fell in love so very suddenly.</p>
			<p>Yes, an’ please your honour, if he is in the way of it⁠⸺⁠replied <i>Trim</i>.</p>
			<p>I prithee, quoth my uncle <i>Toby</i>, inform me how this matter happened.</p>
			<p>⸺⁠With all pleasure, said the corporal, making a bow.</p>
