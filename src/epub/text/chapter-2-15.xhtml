			<p>In popped Corporal <i>Trim</i> with <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Stevinus</i>:⁠—But ’twas too late,⁠—all the discourse had been exhausted without him, and was running into a new channel.⁠—You may take the book home again, <i>Trim</i>, said my uncle <i>Toby</i>, nodding to him.</p>
			<p>But prithee, Corporal, quoth my father, drolling,⁠—look first into it, and see if thou canst spy aught of a sailing chariot in it.</p>
			<p>Corporal <i>Trim</i>, by being in the service, had learned to obey,⁠—and not to remonstrate;⁠—so taking the book to a side-table, and running over the leaves; An’ please your Honour, said <i>Trim</i>, I can see no such thing;⁠—however, continued the Corporal, drolling a little in his turn, I’ll make sure work of it, an’ please your Honour;⁠—so taking hold of the two covers of the book, one in each hand, and letting the leaves fall down, as he bent the covers back, he gave the book a good sound shake.</p>
			<p>There is something falling out, however, said <i>Trim</i>, an’ please your Honour;⁠—but it is not a chariot, or anything like one:⁠—Prithee, Corporal, said my father, smiling, what is it then?⁠—I think, answered <i>Trim</i>, stooping to take it up,⁠⸺’tis more like a sermon,⁠⸻for it begins with a text of scripture, and the chapter and verse;⁠—and then goes on, not as a chariot, but like a sermon directly.</p>
			<p>The company smiled.</p>
			<p>I cannot conceive how it is possible, quoth my uncle <i>Toby</i>, for such a thing as a sermon to have got into my <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Stevinus</i>.</p>
			<p>I think ’tis a sermon, replied <i>Trim</i>;⁠—but if it please your Honours, as it is a fair hand, I will read you a page;⁠—for <i>Trim</i>, you must know, loved to hear himself read almost as well as talk.</p>
			<p>I have ever a strong propensity, said my father, to look into things which cross my way, by such strange fatalities as these;⁠—and as we have nothing better to do, at least till <i>Obadiah</i> gets back, I shall be obliged to you, brother, if <abbr>Dr.</abbr> <i>Slop</i> has no objection to it, to order the Corporal to give us a page or two of it,⁠—if he is as able to do it, as he seems willing. An’ please your Honour, quoth <i>Trim</i>, I officiated two whole campaigns, in <i>Flanders</i>, as clerk to the chaplain of the regiment.⁠⸺⁠He can read it, quoth my uncle <i>Toby</i>, as well as I can.⁠⸺⁠<i>Trim</i>, I assure you, was the best scholar in my company, and should have had the next halberd, but for the poor fellow’s misfortune. Corporal <i>Trim</i> laid his hand upon his heart, and made an humble bow to his master;⁠—then laying down his hat upon the floor, and taking up the sermon in his left hand, in order to have his right at liberty,⁠⸺⁠he advanced, nothing doubting, into the middle of the room, where he could best see, and be best seen by his audience.</p>
