			<p>When <i>Susannah</i> told the corporal the misadventure of the sash, with all the circumstances which attended the <em>murder</em> of me,⁠—(as she called it)⁠—the blood forsook his cheeks,⁠—all accessaries in murder being principals,⁠—<i>Trim’s</i> conscience told him he was as much to blame as <i>Susannah</i>,⁠—and if the doctrine had been true, my uncle <i>Toby</i> had as much of the bloodshed to answer for to heaven, as either of ’em;⁠—so that neither reason or instinct, separate or together, could possibly have guided <i>Susannah’s</i> steps to so proper an asylum. It is in vain to leave this to the Reader’s imagination:⁠—to form any kind of hypothesis that will render these propositions feasible, he must cudgel his brains sore,⁠—and to do it without,⁠—he must have such brains as no reader ever had before him.⁠⸺⁠Why should I put them either to trial or to torture? ’Tis my own affair: I’ll explain it myself.</p>
