				<p>I wish my uncle <i>Toby</i> had been a water-drinker; for then the thing had been accounted for, That the first moment Widow <i>Wadman</i> saw him, she felt something stirring within her in his favour⁠—Something!⁠—something.</p>
				<p>—Something perhaps more than friendship⁠—less than love⁠—something⁠—no matter what⁠—no matter where⁠—I would not give a single hair off my mule’s tail, and be obliged to pluck it off myself (indeed the villain has not many to spare, and is not a little vicious into the bargain), to be let by your worships into the secret⁠⸺⁠</p>
				<p>But the truth is, my uncle <i>Toby</i> was not a water-drinker; he drank it neither pure nor mix’d, or anyhow, or anywhere, except fortuitously upon some advanced posts, where better liquor was not to be had⁠⸺⁠or during the time he was under cure; when the surgeon telling him it would extend the fibres, and bring them sooner into contact⁠⸺⁠my uncle <i>Toby</i> drank it for quietness sake.</p>
				<p>Now as all the world knows, that no effect in nature can be produced without a cause, and as it is as well known, that my uncle <i>Toby</i> was neither a weaver⁠—a gardener, or a gladiator⁠⸺⁠unless as a captain, you will needs have him one⁠—but then he was only a captain of foot⁠—and besides, the whole is an equivocation⁠⸺⁠There is nothing left for us to suppose, but that my uncle <i>Toby’s</i> leg⁠⸺⁠but that will avail us little in the present hypothesis, unless it had proceeded from some ailment <em>in the foot</em>⁠—whereas his leg was not emaciated from any disorder in his foot⁠—for my uncle <i>Toby’s</i> leg was not emaciated at all. It was a little stiff and awkward, from a total disuse of it, for the three years he lay confined at my father’s house in town; but it was plump and muscular, and in all other respects as good and promising a leg as the other.</p>
				<p>I declare, I do not recollect any one opinion or passage of my life, where my understanding was more at a loss to make ends meet, and torture the chapter I had been writing, to the service of the chapter following it, than in the present case: one would think I took a pleasure in running into difficulties of this kind, merely to make fresh experiments of getting out of ’em⁠⸺⁠Inconsiderate soul that thou art! What! are not the unavoidable distresses with which, as an author and a man, thou art hemm’d in on every side of thee⁠⸺⁠are they, <i>Tristram</i>, not sufficient, but thou must entangle thyself still more?</p>
				<p>Is it not enough that thou art in debt, and that thou hast ten cartloads of thy fifth and sixth volumes still⁠—still unsold, and art almost at thy wit’s ends, how to get them off thy hands?</p>
				<p>To this hour art thou not tormented with the vile asthma that thou gattest in skating against the wind in <i>Flanders?</i> and is it but two months ago, that in a fit of laughter, on seeing a cardinal make water like a quirister (with both hands) thou brakest a vessel in thy lungs, whereby, in two hours, thou lost as many quarts of blood; and hadst thou lost as much more, did not the faculty tell thee⁠⸻it would have amounted to a gallon?⁠⸻</p>
