			<p>My uncle <i>Toby</i> took the ivory pipe out of the corporal’s hand,⁠—looked at it for half a minute, and returned it.</p>
			<p>In less than two minutes, my uncle <i>Toby</i> took the pipe from the corporal again, and raised it halfway to his mouth⁠⸺⁠then hastily gave it back a second time.</p>
			<p>The corporal redoubled the attack,⁠⸺⁠my uncle <i>Toby</i> smiled,⁠⸺⁠then looked grave,⁠⸺⁠then smiled for a moment,⁠⸺⁠then looked serious for a long time;⁠⸺⁠Give me hold of the ivory pipe, <i>Trim</i>, said my uncle <i>Toby</i>⁠⸺⁠my uncle <i>Toby</i> put it to his lips,⁠⸺⁠drew it back directly,⁠—gave a peep over the hornbeam hedge;⁠⸺⁠never did my uncle <i>Toby’s</i> mouth water so much for a pipe in his life.⁠⸺⁠My uncle <i>Toby</i> retired into the sentry-box with the pipe in his hand.⁠⸻</p>
			<p>⸺⁠Dear uncle <i>Toby!</i> don’t go into the sentry-box with the pipe,⁠—there’s no trusting a man’s self with such a thing in such a corner.</p>
