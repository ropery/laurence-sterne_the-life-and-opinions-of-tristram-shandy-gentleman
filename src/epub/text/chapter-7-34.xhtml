			<p>⸺⁠But it is an indubitable verity, continued I, addressing myself to the commissary, changing only the form of my asseveration⁠⸺⁠that I owe the king of <i>France</i> nothing but my goodwill; for he is a very honest man, and I wish him all health and pastime in the world⁠⸺⁠</p>
			<p><i xml:lang="fr">Pardonnez moi</i>⁠—replied the commissary, you are indebted to him six livres four sous, for the next post from hence to <abbr>St.</abbr> <i>Fons</i>, in your route to <i>Avignon</i>⁠—which being a post royal, you pay double for the horses and postillion⁠—otherwise ’twould have amounted to no more than three livres two sous⁠⸺⁠</p>
			<p>⸺⁠But I don’t go by land; said I.</p>
			<p>⸺⁠You may if you please; replied the commissary⁠⸺⁠</p>
			<p>Your most obedient servant⁠⸺⁠said I, making him a low bow⁠⸺⁠</p>
			<p>The commissary, with all the sincerity of grave good breeding⁠—made me one, as low again.⁠⸺⁠I never was more disconcerted with a bow in my life.</p>
			<p>⸺⁠The devil take the serious character of these people! quoth I⁠—(aside) they understand no more of <strong>irony</strong> than this⁠⸺⁠</p>
			<p>The comparison was standing close by with his panniers⁠—but something seal’d up my lips⁠—I could not pronounce the name⁠—</p>
			<p>Sir, said I, collecting myself⁠—it is not my intention to take post⁠⸺⁠</p>
			<p>—But you may⁠—said he, persisting in his first reply⁠—you may take post if you choose⁠⸺⁠</p>
			<p>—And I may take salt to my pickled herring, said I, if I choose⁠⸺⁠</p>
			<p>—But I do not choose⁠—</p>
			<p>—But you must pay for it, whether you do or no.</p>
			<p>Aye! for the salt; said I (I know)⁠⸺⁠</p>
			<p>—And for the post too; added he. Defend me! cried I⁠⸺⁠</p>
			<p>I travel by water⁠—I am going down the <i>Rhône</i> this very afternoon⁠—my baggage is in the boat⁠—and I have actually paid nine livres for my passage⁠⸺⁠</p>
			<p><i xml:lang="fr">C’est tout egal</i>⁠—’tis all one; said he.</p>
			<p><i xml:lang="fr">Bon Dieu!</i> what, pay for the way I go! and for the way I do <em>not</em> go!</p>
			<p>⸺⁠<i xml:lang="fr">C’est tout egal</i>; replied the commissary⁠⸺⁠</p>
			<p>⸺⁠The devil it is! said I⁠—but I will go to ten thousand Bastiles first⁠⸺⁠</p>
			<p><em>O England! England!</em> thou land of liberty, and climate of good sense, thou tenderest of mothers⁠—and gentlest of nurses, cried I, kneeling upon one knee, as I was beginning my apostrophe.</p>
			<p>When the director of Madam <i>Le Blanc’s</i> conscience coming in at that instant, and seeing a person in black, with a face as pale as ashes, at his devotions⁠—looking still paler by the contrast and distress of his drapery⁠—ask’d, if I stood in want of the aids of the church⁠⸺⁠</p>
			<p>I go by <strong>water</strong>⁠—said I⁠—and here’s another will be for making me pay for going by <strong>oil</strong>.</p>
