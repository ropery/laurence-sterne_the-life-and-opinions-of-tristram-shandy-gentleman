			<p>As <i>Francis</i> the first of <i>France</i> was one winterly night warming himself over the embers of a wood fire, and talking with his first minister of sundry things for the good of the state<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-15" id="noteref-15" epub:type="noteref">15</a>⁠—It would not be amiss, said the king, stirring up the embers with his cane, if this good understanding betwixt ourselves and <i>Switzerland</i> was a little strengthened.⁠—There is no end, Sire, replied the minister, in giving money to these people⁠—they would swallow up the treasury of <i>France</i>.⁠—Poo! poo! answered the king⁠—there are more ways, <abbr>Mons.</abbr> <i xml:lang="fr">le Premier</i>, of bribing states, besides that of giving money⁠—I’ll pay <i>Switzerland</i> the honour of standing godfather for my next child.⁠⸺⁠Your majesty, said the minister, in so doing, would have all the grammarians in <i>Europe</i> upon your back;⁠⸺⁠<i>Switzerland</i>, as a republick, being a female, can in no construction be godfather.⁠—She may be godmother, replied <i>Francis</i> hastily⁠—so announce my intentions by a courier tomorrow morning.</p>
			<p>I am astonished, said <i>Francis</i> the First, (that day fortnight) speaking to his minister as he entered the closet, that we have had no answer from <i>Switzerland</i>.⁠⸺⁠Sire, I wait upon you this moment, said <abbr>Mons.</abbr> <i xml:lang="fr">le Premier</i>, to lay before you my dispatches upon that business.⁠—They take it kindly, said the king.⁠—They do, Sire, replied the minister, and have the highest sense of the honour your majesty has done them⁠⸺⁠but the republick, as godmother, claims her right, in this case, of naming the child.</p>
			<p>In all reason, quoth the king⁠⸺⁠she will christen him <i>Francis</i>, or <i>Henry</i>, or <i>Lewis</i>, or some name that she knows will be agreeable to us. Your majesty is deceived, replied the minister⁠⸺⁠I have this hour received a dispatch from our resident, with the determination of the republick on that point also.⁠⸺⁠And what name has the republick fixed upon for the Dauphin?⁠⸺⁠<i>Shadrach</i>, <i>Meshech</i>, <i>Abed-nego</i>, replied the minister.⁠—By Saint <i>Peter’s</i> girdle, I will have nothing to do with the <i>Swiss</i>, cried <i>Francis</i> the First, pulling up his breeches and walking hastily across the floor.</p>
			<p>Your majesty, replied the minister calmly, cannot bring yourself off.</p>
			<p>We’ll pay them in money⁠⸻said the king.</p>
			<p>Sire, there are not sixty thousand crowns in the treasury, answered the minister.⁠⸺⁠I’ll pawn the best jewel in my crown, quoth <i>Francis</i> the First.</p>
			<p>Your honour stands pawn’d already in this matter, answered Monsieur <i xml:lang="fr">le Premier</i>.</p>
			<p>Then, <abbr>Mons.</abbr> <i xml:lang="fr">le Premier</i>, said the king, by⁠⸻we’ll go to war with ’em.</p>
