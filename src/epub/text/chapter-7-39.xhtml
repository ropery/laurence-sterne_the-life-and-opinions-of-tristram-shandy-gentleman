			<p>And now for <i>Lippius’s</i> clock! said I, with the air of a man, who had got thro’ all his difficulties⁠⸺⁠nothing can prevent us seeing that, and the <i>Chinese</i> history, <abbr>etc.</abbr>, except the time, said <i>François</i>⁠⸺⁠for ’tis almost eleven⁠—Then we must speed the faster, said I, striding it away to the cathedral.</p>
			<p>I cannot say, in my heart, that it gave me any concern in being told by one of the minor canons, as I was entering the west door,⁠—That <i>Lippius’s</i> great clock was all out of joints, and had not gone for some years⁠⸺⁠It will give me the more time, thought I, to peruse the <i>Chinese</i> history; and besides I shall be able to give the world a better account of the clock in its decay, than I could have done in its flourishing condition⁠⸺⁠</p>
			<p>⸺⁠And so away I posted to the college of the Jesuits.</p>
			<p>Now it is with the project of getting a peep at the history of <i>China</i> in <i>Chinese</i> characters⁠—as with many others I could mention, which strike the fancy only at a distance; for as I came nearer and nearer to the point⁠—my blood cool’d⁠—the freak gradually went off, till at length I would not have given a cherrystone to have it gratified⁠⸻The truth was, my time was short, and my heart was at the Tomb of the Lovers⁠⸺⁠I wish to God, said I, as I got the rapper in my hand, that the key of the library may be but lost; it fell out as well⁠⸻</p>
			<p><em>For all the</em> <b>Jesuits</b> <em>had got the cholic</em>⁠—and to that degree, as never was known in the memory of the oldest practitioner.</p>
