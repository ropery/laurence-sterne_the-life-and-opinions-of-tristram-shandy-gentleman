			<p>It was to my uncle <i>Toby’s</i> eternal honour,⁠⸺⁠though I tell it only for the sake of those, who, when coop’d in betwixt a natural and a positive law, know not, for their souls, which way in the world to turn themselves⁠⸺⁠That notwithstanding my uncle <i>Toby</i> was warmly engaged at that time in carrying on the siege of <i>Dendermond</i>, parallel with the allies, who pressed theirs on so vigorously, that they scarce allowed him time to get his dinner⁠⸺⁠that nevertheless he gave up <i>Dendermond</i>, though he had already made a lodgment upon the counterscarp;⁠—and bent his whole thoughts towards the private distresses at the inn; and except that he ordered the garden gate to be bolted up, by which he might be said to have turned the siege of <i>Dendermond</i> into a blockade,⁠—he left <i>Dendermond</i> to itself⁠—to be relieved or not by the <i>French</i> king, as the <i>French</i> king thought good; and only considered how he himself should relieve the poor lieutenant and his son.</p>
			<p>⸺⁠That kind <b>Being</b>, who is a friend to the friendless, shall recompence thee for this.</p>
			<p>Thou hast left this matter short, said my uncle <i>Toby</i> to the corporal, as he was putting him to bed,⁠⸺⁠and I will tell thee in what, <i>Trim</i>.⁠⸺⁠In the first place, when thou madest an offer of my services to <i>Le Fever</i>,⁠⸺⁠as sickness and travelling are both expensive, and thou knowest he was but a poor lieutenant, with a son to subsist as well as himself out of his pay,⁠—that thou didst not make an offer to him of my purse; because, had he stood in need, thou knowest, <i>Trim</i>, he had been as welcome to it as myself.⁠⸺⁠Your honour knows, said the corporal, I had no orders;⁠⸺⁠True, quoth my uncle <i>Toby</i>,⁠—thou didst very right, <i>Trim</i>, as a soldier,⁠—but certainly very wrong as a man.</p>
			<p>In the second place, for which, indeed, thou hast the same excuse, continued my uncle <i>Toby</i>,⁠⸺⁠when thou offeredst him whatever was in my house,⁠⸺⁠thou shouldst have offered him my house too:⁠⸺⁠A sick brother officer should have the best quarters, <i>Trim</i>, and if we had him with us,⁠—we could tend and look to him:⁠⸺⁠Thou art an excellent nurse thyself, <i>Trim</i>,⁠—and what with thy care of him, and the old woman’s, and his boy’s, and mine together, we might recruit him again at once, and set him upon his legs.⁠⸻</p>
			<p>⸺⁠In a fortnight or three weeks, added my uncle <i>Toby</i>, smiling,⁠⸺⁠he might march.⁠⸺⁠He will never march; an’ please your honour, in this world, said the corporal:⁠⸺⁠He will march; said my uncle <i>Toby</i>, rising up, from the side of the bed, with one shoe off:⁠⸺⁠An’ please your honour, said the corporal, he will never march but to his grave:⁠⸺⁠He shall march, cried my uncle <i>Toby</i>, marching the foot which had a shoe on, though without advancing an inch,⁠—he shall march to his regiment.⁠⸺⁠He cannot stand it, said the corporal;⁠⸺⁠He shall be supported, said my uncle <i>Toby</i>;⁠⸺⁠He’ll drop at last, said the corporal, and what will become of his boy?⁠⸺⁠He shall not drop, said my uncle <i>Toby</i>, firmly.⁠⸺⁠A-well-o’-day,⁠—do what we can for him, said <i>Trim</i>, maintaining his point,⁠—the poor soul will die:⁠⸺⁠He shall not die, by G⁠⸺, cried my uncle <i>Toby</i>.</p>
			<p>—The <strong>accusing spirit</strong>, which flew up to heaven’s chancery with the oath, blush’d as he gave it in;⁠—and the <strong>recording angel</strong>, as he wrote it down, dropp’d a tear upon the word, and blotted it out forever.</p>
