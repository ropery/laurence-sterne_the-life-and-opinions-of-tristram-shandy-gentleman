			<p>O there is a sweet æra in the life of man, when (the brain being tender and fibrillous, and more like pap than anything else)⁠⸺⁠a story read of two fond lovers, separated from each other by cruel parents, and by still more cruel destiny⁠⸺⁠</p>
			<p class="indent"><i>Amandus</i>⁠⸺⁠He<br/>
			<i>Amanda</i>⁠⸺⁠She⁠⸺⁠</p>
			<p>each ignorant of the other’s course,</p>
			<p class="indent">He⁠⸺⁠east<br/>
			She⁠⸺⁠west</p>
			<p><i>Amandus</i> taken captive by the <i>Turks</i>, and carried to the emperor of <i>Morocco’s</i> court, where the princess of <i>Morocco</i> falling in love with him, keeps him twenty years in prison for the love of his <i>Amanda</i>.⁠⸺⁠</p>
			<p>She⁠—(<i>Amanda</i>) all the time wandering barefoot, and with dishevell’d hair, o’er rocks and mountains, enquiring for <i>Amandus!</i>⁠⸺⁠<i>Amandus! Amandus!</i>⁠—making every hill and valley to echo back his name⁠⸺⁠</p>
			<p class="indent">
				<i>Amandus! Amandus!</i>
			</p>
			<p>at every town and city, sitting down forlorn at the gate⁠⸺⁠Has <i>Amandus!</i>⁠—has my <i>Amandus</i> enter’d?⁠⸺⁠till,⁠⸺⁠going round, and round, and round the world⁠⸺⁠chance unexpected bringing them at the same moment of the night, though by different ways, to the gate of <i>Lyons</i>, their native city, and each in well-known accents calling out aloud,</p>
			<p class="indent">
				<span>
					<span>Is <i>Amandus</i></span>
					<span>Is my <i>Amanda</i></span>
				</span>
				<span>}</span>
				<span>still alive?</span>
			</p>
			<p>they fly into each other’s arms, and both drop down dead for joy.</p>
			<p>There is a soft æra in every gentle mortal’s life, where such a story affords more pabulum to the brain, than all the <i>Frusts</i>, and <i>Crusts</i>, and <i>Rusts</i> of antiquity, which travellers can cook up for it.</p>
			<p>⸺’Twas all that stuck on the right side of the cullender in my own, of what <i>Spon</i> and others, in their accounts of <i>Lyons</i>, had <em>strained</em> into it; and finding, moreover, in some Itinerary, but in what God knows⁠⸺⁠That sacred to the fidelity of <i>Amandus</i> and <i>Amanda</i>, a tomb was built without the gates, where, to this hour, lovers called upon them to attest their truths⁠⸺⁠I never could get into a scrape of that kind in my life, but this <em>tomb of the lovers</em> would, somehow or other, come in at the close⁠⸺⁠nay such a kind of empire had it establish’d over me, that I could seldom think or speak of <i>Lyons</i>⁠—and sometimes not so much as see even a <i>Lyons-waistcoat</i>, but this remnant of antiquity would present itself to my fancy; and I have often said in my wild way of running on⁠⸺⁠tho’ I fear with some irreverence⁠⸺“I thought this shrine (neglected as it was) as valuable as that of <i>Mecca</i>, and so little short, except in wealth, of the <i>Santa Casa</i> itself, that some time or other, I would go a pilgrimage (though I had no other business at <i>Lyons</i>) on purpose to pay it a visit.”</p>
			<p>In my list, therefore, of <i>Videnda</i> at <i>Lyons</i>, this, tho’ <em>last</em>,⁠—was not, you see, <em>least</em>; so taking a dozen or two of longer strides than usual across my room, just whilst it passed my brain, I walked down calmly into the Basse Cour, in order to sally forth; and having called for my bill⁠—as it was uncertain whether I should return to my inn, I had paid it⁠⸺⁠had moreover given the maid ten sous, and was just receiving the dernier compliments of Monsieur <i>Le Blanc</i>, for a pleasant voyage down the <i>Rhône</i>⁠⸺⁠when I was stopped at the gate⁠⸺⁠</p>
