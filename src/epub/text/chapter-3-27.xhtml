			<p>⸺⁠This unfortunate drawbridge of yours, quoth my father⁠⸺⁠God bless your honour, cried <i>Trim</i>, ’tis a bridge for master’s nose.⁠⸺⁠In bringing him into the world with his vile instruments, he has crushed his nose, <i>Susannah</i> says, as flat as a pancake to his face, and he is making a false bridge with a piece of cotton and a thin piece of whalebone out of <i>Susannah’s</i> stays, to raise it up.</p>
			<p>⸺⁠Lead me, brother <i>Toby</i>, cried my father, to my room this instant.</p>
