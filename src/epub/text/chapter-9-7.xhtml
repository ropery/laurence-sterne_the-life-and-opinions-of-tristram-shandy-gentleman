			<p>As <i>Tom</i>, an’ please your honour, had no business at that time with the <i>Moorish</i> girl, he passed on into the room beyond, to talk to the <i>Jew’s</i> widow about love⁠⸺⁠and this pound of sausages; and being, as I have told your honour, an open cheery-hearted lad, with his character wrote in his looks and carriage, he took a chair, and without much apology, but with great civility at the same time, placed it close to her at the table, and sat down.</p>
			<p>There is nothing so awkward, as courting a woman, an’ please your honour, whilst she is making sausages⁠⸺⁠So <i>Tom</i> began a discourse upon them; first, gravely,⁠⸺“as how they were made⁠⸺⁠with what meats, herbs, and spices”⁠—Then a little gayly,⁠—as, “With what skins⁠⸺⁠and if they never burst⁠⸺⁠Whether the largest were not the best?”⁠⸺⁠and so on⁠—taking care only as he went along, to season what he had to say upon sausages, rather under than over;⁠⸺⁠that he might have room to act in⁠⸺⁠</p>
			<p>It was owing to the neglect of that very precaution, said my uncle <i>Toby</i>, laying his hand upon <i>Trim’s</i> shoulder, that Count <i>De la Motte</i> lost the battle of <i>Wynendale</i>: he pressed too speedily into the wood; which if he had not done, <i>Lisle</i> had not fallen into our hands, nor <i>Ghent</i> and <i>Bruges</i>, which both followed her example; it was so late in the year, continued my uncle <i>Toby</i>, and so terrible a season came on, that if things had not fallen out as they did, our troops must have perish’d in the open field.⁠⸺⁠</p>
			<p>⸺⁠Why, therefore, may not battles, an’ please your honour, as well as marriages, be made in heaven?⁠—My uncle <i>Toby</i> mused⁠⸺⁠</p>
			<p>Religion inclined him to say one thing, and his high idea of military skill tempted him to say another; so not being able to frame a reply exactly to his mind⁠⸺⁠my uncle <i>Toby</i> said nothing at all; and the corporal finished his story.</p>
			<p>As <i>Tom</i> perceived, an’ please your honour, that he gained ground, and that all he had said upon the subject of sausages was kindly taken, he went on to help her a little in making them.⁠⸺⁠First, by taking hold of the ring of the sausage whilst she stroked the forced meat down with her hand⁠⸺⁠then by cutting the strings into proper lengths, and holding them in his hand, whilst she took them out one by one⁠⸺⁠then, by putting them across her mouth, that she might take them out as she wanted them⁠⸺⁠and so on from little to more, till at last he adventured to tie the sausage himself, whilst she held the snout.⁠⸺⁠</p>
			<p>⸺⁠Now a widow, an’ please your honour, always chooses a second husband as unlike the first as she can: so the affair was more than half settled in her mind before <i>Tom</i> mentioned it.</p>
			<p>She made a feint however of defending herself, by snatching up a sausage:⁠⸺⁠<i>Tom</i> instantly laid hold of another⁠⸻</p>
			<p>But seeing <i>Tom’s</i> had more gristle in it⁠⸻</p>
			<p>She signed the capitulation⁠⸺⁠and <i>Tom</i> sealed it; and there was an end of the matter.</p>
