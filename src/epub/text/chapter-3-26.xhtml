			<p>When <i>Trim</i> came in and told my father, that <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> <i>Slop</i> was in the kitchen, and busy in making a bridge⁠—my uncle <i>Toby</i>⁠⸺⁠the affair of the jackboots having just then raised a train of military ideas in his brain⁠⸺⁠took it instantly for granted that <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> <i>Slop</i> was making a model of the marquis <i>d’Hôpital’s</i> bridge.⁠⸺’Tis very obliging in him, quoth my uncle <i>Toby</i>;⁠—pray give my humble service to <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> <i>Slop</i>, <i>Trim</i>, and tell him I thank him heartily.</p>

			<p>When <i>Trim’s</i> answer, in an instant, tore the laurel from his brows, and twisted it to pieces.</p>
