			<p>Albeit, gentle reader, I have lusted earnestly, and endeavoured carefully (according to the measure of such a slender skill as God has vouchsafed me, and as convenient leisure from other occasions of needful profit and healthful pastime have permitted) that these little books which I here put into thy hands, might stand instead of many bigger books⁠—yet have I carried myself towards thee in such fanciful guise of careless disport, that right sore am I ashamed now to intreat thy lenity seriously⁠⸻in beseeching thee to believe it of me, that in the story of my father and his christian-names⁠—I have no thoughts of treading upon <i>Francis</i> the First⁠⸺⁠nor in the affair of the nose⁠—upon <i>Francis</i> the Ninth⁠—nor in the character of my uncle <i>Toby</i>⁠⸺⁠of characterizing the militiating spirits of my country⁠—the wound upon his groin, is a wound to every comparison of that kind⁠—nor by <i>Trim</i>⁠—that I meant the duke of <i>Ormond</i>⁠⸺⁠or that my book is wrote against predestination, or free-will, or taxes⁠—If ’tis wrote against anything,⁠⸺’tis wrote, an’ please your worships, against the spleen! in order, by a more frequent and a more convulsive elevation and depression of the diaphragm, and the succussations of the intercostal and abdominal muscles in laughter, to drive the <em>gall</em> and other <em>bitter juices</em> from the gallbladder, liver, and sweetbread of his majesty’s subjects, with all the inimicitious passions which belong to them, down into their duodenums.</p>
