			<p>⸻To us, <i>Jonathan</i>, who know not what want or care is⁠—who live here in the service of two of the best of masters⁠—(bating in my own case his majesty King <i>William</i> the Third, whom I had the honour to serve both in <i>Ireland</i> and <i>Flanders</i>)⁠—I own it, that from <i>Whitsontide</i> to within three weeks of <i>Christmas</i>,⁠—’tis not long⁠—’tis like nothing;⁠—but to those, <i>Jonathan</i>, who know what death is, and what havock and destruction he can make, before a man can well wheel about⁠—’tis like a whole age.⁠—O <i>Jonathan!</i> ’twould make a good-natured man’s heart bleed, to consider, continued the corporal (standing perpendicularly), how low many a brave and upright fellow has been laid since that time!⁠—And trust me, <i>Susy</i>, added the corporal, turning to <i>Susannah</i>, whose eyes were swimming in water,⁠—before that time comes round again,⁠—many a bright eye will be dim.⁠—<i>Susannah</i> placed it to the right side of the page⁠—she wept⁠—but she court’sied too.⁠—Are we not, continued <i>Trim</i>, looking still at <i>Susannah</i>⁠—are we not like a flower of the field⁠—a tear of pride stole in betwixt every two tears of humiliation⁠—else no tongue could have described <i>Susannah’s</i> affliction⁠—is not all flesh grass?⁠—’Tis clay,⁠—’tis dirt.⁠—They all looked directly at the scullion,⁠—the scullion had just been scouring a fish-kettle.⁠—It was not fair.⁠⸺⁠</p>
			<p>—What is the finest face that ever man looked at!⁠—I could hear <i>Trim</i> talk so forever, cried <i>Susannah</i>,⁠—what is it! (<i>Susannah</i> laid her hand upon <i>Trim’s</i> shoulder)⁠—but corruption?⁠⸺⁠<i>Susannah</i> took it off.</p>
			<p>Now I love you for this⁠—and ’tis this delicious mixture within you which makes you dear creatures what you are⁠—and he who hates you for it⁠⸻all I can say of the matter is⁠—That he has either a pumpkin for his head⁠—or a pippin for his heart,⁠—and whenever he is dissected ’twill be found so.</p>
