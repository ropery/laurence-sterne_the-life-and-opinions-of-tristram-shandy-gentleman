			<p>Stay⁠⸺⁠I have a small account to settle with the reader before <i>Trim</i> can go on with his harangue.⁠—It shall be done in two minutes.</p>
			<p>Amongst many other book-debts, all of which I shall discharge in due time,⁠—I own myself a debtor to the world for two items,⁠—a chapter upon <em>chambermaids and buttonholes</em>, which, in the former part of my work, I promised and fully intended to pay off this year: but some of your worships and reverences telling me, that the two subjects, especially so connected together, might endanger the morals of the world,⁠—I pray the chapter upon chambermaids and buttonholes may be forgiven me,⁠—and that they will accept of the last chapter in lieu of it; which is nothing, an’t please your reverences, but a chapter of <em>chambermaids, green gowns, and old hats</em>.</p>
			<p><i>Trim</i> took his off the ground,⁠—put it upon his head,⁠—and then went on with his oration upon death, in manner and form following.</p>
