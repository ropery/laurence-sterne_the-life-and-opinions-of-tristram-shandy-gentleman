			<p>These attacks of <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> <i>Wadman</i>, you will readily conceive to be of different kinds; varying from each other, like the attacks which history is full of, and from the same reasons. A general looker-on would scarce allow them to be attacks at all⁠⸺⁠or if he did, would confound them all together⁠⸺⁠but I write not to them: it will be time enough to be a little more exact in my descriptions of them, as I come up to them, which will not be for some chapters; having nothing more to add in this, but that in a bundle of original papers and drawings which my father took care to roll up by themselves, there is a plan of <i>Bouchain</i> in perfect preservation (and shall be kept so, whilst I have power to preserve anything), upon the lower corner of which, on the right hand side, there is still remaining the marks of a snuffy finger and thumb, which there is all the reason in the world to imagine, were <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> <i>Wadman’s</i>; for the opposite side of the margin, which I suppose to have been my uncle <i>Toby’s</i>, is absolutely clean: This seems an authenticated record of one of these attacks; for there are vestigia of the two punctures partly grown up, but still visible on the opposite corner of the map, which are unquestionably the very holes, through which it has been pricked up in the sentry-box⁠⸺⁠</p>
			<p>By all that is priestly! I value this precious relick, with its <em>stigmata</em> and <em>pricks</em>, more than all the relicks of the <i>Romish</i> church⁠⸺⁠always excepting, when I am writing upon these matters, the pricks which entered the flesh of <abbr>St.</abbr> <i>Radagunda</i> in the desert, which in your road from <b>Fesse</b> to <b>Cluny</b>, the nuns of that name will show you for love.</p>
