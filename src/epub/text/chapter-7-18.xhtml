			<p>The <i>French</i> are certainly misunderstood:⁠⸺⁠but whether the fault is theirs, in not sufficiently explaining themselves; or speaking with that exact limitation and precision which one would expect on a point of such importance, and which, moreover, is so likely to be contested by us⁠⸺⁠or whether the fault may not be altogether on our side, in not understanding their language always so critically as to know “what they would be at”⁠⸺⁠I shall not decide; but ’tis evident to me, when they affirm, “<i>That they who have seen <i>Paris</i>, have seen everything</i>,” they must mean to speak of those who have seen it by daylight.</p>
			<p>As for candlelight⁠—I give it up⁠⸺⁠I have said before, there was no depending upon it⁠—and I repeat it again; but not because the lights and shades are too sharp⁠—or the tints confounded⁠—or that there is neither beauty or keeping, etc⁠ ⁠… for that’s not truth⁠—but it is an uncertain light in this respect, That in all the five hundred grand Hôtels, which they number up to you in <i>Paris</i>⁠—and the five hundred good things, at a modest computation (for ’tis only allowing one good thing to a Hôtel), which by candlelight are best to be <em>seen</em>, <em>felt</em>, <em>heard</em>, and <em>understood</em> (which, by the by, is a quotation from <i>Lilly</i>)⁠⸺⁠the devil a one of us out of fifty, can get our heads fairly thrust in amongst them.</p>
			<p>This is no part of the <i>French</i> computation: ’tis simply this,</p>
			<p>That by the last survey taken in the year one thousand seven hundred and sixteen, since which time there have been considerable argumentations, <i>Paris</i> doth contain nine hundred streets; (<abbr>viz.</abbr>)</p>
			<p>In the quarter called the <i>City</i>⁠—there are fifty-three streets.</p>
			<p>In <abbr>St.</abbr> <i>James</i> of the Shambles, fifty-five streets.</p>
			<p>In <abbr>St.</abbr> <i>Oportune</i>, thirty-four streets.</p>
			<p>In the quarter of the <i>Louvre</i>, twenty-five streets.</p>
			<p>In the <i>Palace Royal</i>, or <abbr>St.</abbr> <i>Honorius</i>, forty-nine streets.</p>
			<p>In <i><abbr>Mont.</abbr> Martyr</i>, forty-one streets.</p>
			<p>In <abbr>St.</abbr> <i>Eustace</i>, twenty-nine streets.</p>
			<p>In the <i>Halles</i>, twenty-seven streets.</p>
			<p>In <abbr>St.</abbr> <i>Dennis</i>, fifty-five streets.</p>
			<p>In <abbr>St.</abbr> <i>Martin</i>, fifty-four streets.</p>
			<p>In <abbr>St.</abbr> <i>Paul</i>, or the <i>Mortellerie</i>, twenty-seven streets.</p>
			<p>The <i>Greve</i>, thirty-eight streets.</p>
			<p>In <abbr>St.</abbr> <i>Avoy</i>, or the <i>Verrerie</i>, nineteen streets.</p>
			<p>In the <i>Marais</i>, or the <i>Temple</i>, fifty-two streets.</p>
			<p>In <abbr>St.</abbr> <i>Antony’s</i>, sixty-eight streets.</p>
			<p>In the <i>Place Maubert</i>, eighty-one streets.</p>
			<p>In <abbr>St.</abbr> <i>Bennet</i>, sixty streets.</p>
			<p>In <abbr>St.</abbr> <i>Andrews de Arcs</i>, fifty-one streets.</p>
			<p>In the quarter of the <i>Luxembourg</i>, sixty-two streets.</p>
			<p>And in that of <abbr>St.</abbr> Germain, fifty-five streets, into any of which you may walk; and that when you have seen them with all that belongs to them, fairly by daylight⁠—their gates, their bridges, their squares, their statues - - - and have crusaded it moreover, through all their parish-churches, by no means omitting <abbr>St.</abbr> <i>Roche</i> and <i>Sulpice</i> - - - and to crown all, have taken a walk to the four palaces, which you may see, either with or without the statues and pictures, just as you choose⁠—</p>
			<p>⸺⁠Then you will have seen⁠⸺⁠</p>
			<p>⸺⁠but, ’tis what no one needeth to tell you, for you will read of it yourself upon the portico of the <i>Louvre</i>, in these words,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-31" id="noteref-31" epub:type="noteref">31</a></p>
			<blockquote epub:type="z3998:verse">
				<p>
					<span>Earth no such folks!⁠—No folks e’er such a town</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As Paris is!⁠—Sing, derry, derry, down.</span>
				</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>The <i>French</i> have a <em>gay</em> way of treating everything that is Great; and that is all can be said upon it.</p>
