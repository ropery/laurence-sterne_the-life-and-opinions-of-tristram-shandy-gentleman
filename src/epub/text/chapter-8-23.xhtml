			<p>As soon as the corporal had finished the story of his amour⁠—or rather my uncle <i>Toby</i> for him⁠—<abbr>Mrs.</abbr> <i>Wadman</i> silently sallied forth from her arbour, replaced the pin in her mob, pass’d the wicker-gate, and advanced slowly towards my uncle <i>Toby’s</i> sentry-box: the disposition which <i>Trim</i> had made in my uncle <i>Toby’s</i> mind, was too favourable a crisis to be let slipp’d⁠⸺⁠</p>
			<p>⸺⁠The attack was determin’d upon: it was facilitated still more by my uncle <i>Toby’s</i> having ordered the corporal to wheel off the pioneer’s shovel, the spade, the pickaxe, the picquets, and other military stores which lay scatter’d upon the ground where <i>Dunkirk</i> stood⁠—the corporal had march’d⁠—the field was clear.</p>
			<p>Now, consider, sir, what nonsense it is, either in fighting, or writing, or anything else (whether in rhyme to it, or not) which a man has occasion to do⁠—to act by plan: for if ever Plan, independent of all circumstances, deserved registering in letters of gold (I mean in the archives of <i>Gotham</i>)⁠—it was certainly the <b>Plan</b> of <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> <i>Wadman’s</i> attack of my uncle <i>Toby</i> in his sentry-box, <b>by Plan</b>⁠⸺⁠Now the plan hanging up in it at this juncture, being the Plan of <i>Dunkirk</i>⁠—and the tale of <i>Dunkirk</i> a tale of relaxation, it opposed every impression she could make: and besides, could she have gone upon it⁠—the manoeuvre of fingers and hands in the attack of the sentry-box, was so outdone by that of the fair <i>Beguine’s</i>, in <i>Trim’s</i> story⁠—that just then, that particular attack, however successful before⁠—became the most heartless attack that could be made⁠⸺⁠</p>
			<p>O! let woman alone for this. <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> <i>Wadman</i> had scarce open’d the wicket-gate, when her genius sported with the change of circumstances.</p>
			<p>⸺⁠She formed a new attack in a moment.</p>
