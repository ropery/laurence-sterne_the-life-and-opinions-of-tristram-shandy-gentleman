			<p>It is with <b>love</b> as with <b>cuckoldom</b>⁠⸺⁠</p>
			<p>But now I am talking of beginning a book, and have long had a thing upon my mind to be imparted to the reader, which, if not imparted now, can never be imparted to him as long as I live (whereas the <strong>comparison</strong> may be imparted to him any hour in the day)⁠⸺⁠I’ll just mention it, and begin in good earnest.</p>
			<p>The thing is this.</p>
			<p>That of all the several ways of beginning a book which are now in practice throughout the known world, I am confident my own way of doing it is the best⁠⸺⁠I’m sure it is the most religious⁠⸺⁠for I begin with writing the first sentence⁠⸺⁠and trusting to Almighty God for the second.</p>
			<p>’Twould cure an author forever of the fuss and folly of opening his street-door, and calling in his neighbours and friends, and kinsfolk, with the devil and all his imps, with their hammers and engines, <abbr>etc.</abbr>, only to observe how one sentence of mine follows another, and how the plan follows the whole.</p>
			<p>I wish you saw me half starting out of my chair, with what confidence, as I grasp the elbow of it, I look up⁠⸺⁠catching the idea, even sometimes before it halfway reaches me⁠⸺⁠</p>
			<p>I believe in my conscience I intercept many a thought which heaven intended for another man.</p>
			<p><i>Pope</i> and his Portrait<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-34" id="noteref-34" epub:type="noteref">34</a> are fools to me⁠⸺⁠no martyr is ever so full of faith or fire⁠⸺⁠I wish I could say of good works too⁠⸺⁠but I have no</p>
			<p class="indent">Zeal or Anger⁠⸺⁠or<br/>
			Anger or Zeal⁠⸺⁠</p>
			<p>And till gods and men agree together to call it by the same name⁠⸺⁠the errantest <b>Tartuffe</b>, in science⁠—in politics⁠—or in religion, shall never kindle a spark within me, or have a worse word, or a more unkind greeting, than what he will read in the next chapter.</p>
