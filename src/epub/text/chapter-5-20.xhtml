			<p>The corporal had not taken his measures so badly in this stroke of artilleryship, but that he might have kept the matter entirely to himself, and left <i>Susannah</i> to have sustained the whole weight of the attack, as she could;⁠—true courage is not content with coming off so.⁠⸺⁠The corporal, whether as general or comptroller of the train,⁠—’twas no matter,⁠⸺⁠had done that, without which, as he imagined, the misfortune could never have happened,⁠—<em>at least in</em> Susannah’s <em>hands</em>;⁠⸺⁠How would your honours have behaved?⁠⸺⁠He determined at once, not to take shelter behind <i>Susannah</i>,⁠—but to give it; and with this resolution upon his mind, he marched upright into the parlour, to lay the whole <em>manoeuvre</em> before my uncle <i>Toby</i>.</p>
			<p>My uncle <i>Toby</i> had just then been giving <i>Yorick</i> an account of the battle of <i>Steenkirk</i>, and of the strange conduct of count <i>Solmes</i> in ordering the foot to halt, and the horse to march where it could not act; which was directly contrary to the king’s commands, and proved the loss of the day.</p>
			<p>There are incidents in some families so pat to the purpose of what is going to follow,⁠—they are scarce exceeded by the invention of a dramatic writer;⁠—I mean of ancient days.⁠⸻</p>
			<p><i>Trim</i>, by the help of his forefinger, laid flat upon the table, and the edge of his hand striking across it at right angles, made a shift to tell his story so, that priests and virgins might have listened to it;⁠—and the story being told,⁠—the dialogue went on as follows.</p>
