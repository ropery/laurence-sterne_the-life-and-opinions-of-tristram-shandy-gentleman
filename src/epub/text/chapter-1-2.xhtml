			<p>⸻Then, positively, there is nothing in the question that I can see, either good or bad.⁠⸺⁠Then, let me tell you, Sir, it was a very unseasonable question at least,⁠—because it scattered and dispersed the animal spirits, whose business it was to have escorted and gone hand in hand with the <em><b>Homunculus</b></em>, and conducted him safe to the place destined for his reception.</p>
			<p>The <b>Homunculus</b>, Sir, in however low and ludicrous a light he may appear, in this age of levity, to the eye of folly or prejudice;⁠—to the eye of reason in scientifick research, he stands confess’d⁠—a <b>Being</b> guarded and circumscribed with rights.⁠⸺⁠The minutest philosophers, who, by the by, have the most enlarged understandings (their souls being inversely as their enquiries), show us incontestably, that the <b>Homunculus</b> is created by the same hand,⁠—engender’d in the same course of nature,⁠—endow’d with the same locomotive powers and faculties with us:⁠—That he consists as we do, of skin, hair, fat, flesh, veins, arteries, ligaments, nerves, cartilages, bones, marrow, brains, glands, genitals, humours, and articulations;⁠—is a Being of as much activity,⁠—and, in all senses of the word, as much and as truly our fellow-creature as my Lord Chancellor of <i>England</i>.⁠—He may be benefited,⁠—he may be injured,⁠—he may obtain redress;⁠—in a word, he has all the claims and rights of humanity, which <i>Tully</i>, <i>Puffendorf</i>, or the best ethick writers allow to arise out of that state and relation.</p>
			<p>Now, dear Sir, what if any accident had befallen him in his way alone!⁠—or that, through terror of it, natural to so young a traveller, my little Gentleman had got to his journey’s end miserably spent;⁠—his muscular strength and virility worn down to a thread;⁠—his own animal spirits ruffled beyond description,⁠—and that in this sad disordered state of nerves, he had lain down a prey to sudden starts, or a series of melancholy dreams and fancies, for nine long, long months together.⁠—I tremble to think what a foundation had been laid for a thousand weaknesses both of body and mind, which no skill of the physician or the philosopher could ever afterwards have set thoroughly to rights.</p>
