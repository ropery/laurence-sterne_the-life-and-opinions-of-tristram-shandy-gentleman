			<p>No⁠⸺⁠I think, I said, I would write two volumes every year, provided the vile cough which then tormented me, and which to this hour I dread worse than the devil, would but give me leave⁠—and in another place⁠—(but where, I can’t recollect now) speaking of my book as a <em>machine</em>, and laying my pen and ruler down crosswise upon the table, in order to gain the greater credit to it⁠—I swore it should be kept a going at that rate these forty years, if it pleased but the fountain of life to bless me so long with health and good spirits.</p>
			<p>Now as for my spirits, little have I to lay to their charge⁠—nay so very little (unless the mounting me upon a long stick and playing the fool with me nineteen hours out of the twenty-four, be accusations) that on the contrary, I have much⁠—much to thank ’em for: cheerily have ye made me tread the path of life with all the burdens of it (except its cares) upon my back; in no one moment of my existence, that I remember, have ye once deserted me, or tinged the objects which came in my way, either with sable, or with a sickly green; in dangers ye gilded my horizon with hope, and when <b>Death</b> himself knocked at my door⁠—ye bad him come again; and in so gay a tone of careless indifference did ye do it, that he doubted of his commission⁠⸺⁠</p>
			<p>“⁠—There must certainly be some mistake in this matter,” quoth he.</p>
			<p>Now there is nothing in this world I abominate worse, than to be interrupted in a story⁠⸺⁠and I was that moment telling <i>Eugenius</i> a most tawdry one in my way, of a nun who fancied herself a shellfish, and of a monk damn’d for eating a muscle, and was showing him the grounds and justice of the procedure⁠⸺⁠</p>
			<p>“⁠—Did ever so grave a personage get into so vile a scrape?” quoth Death. Thou hast had a narrow escape, <i>Tristram</i>, said <i>Eugenius</i>, taking hold of my hand as I finished my story⁠⸺⁠</p>
			<p>But there is no <em>living</em>, <i>Eugenius</i>, replied I, at this rate; for as this <em>son of a whore</em> has found out my lodgings⁠⸺⁠</p>
			<p>—You call him rightly, said <i>Eugenius</i>,⁠—for by sin, we are told, he enter’d the world⁠⸺⁠I care not which way he enter’d, quoth I, provided he be not in such a hurry to take me out with him⁠—for I have forty volumes to write, and forty thousand things to say and do which no body in the world will say and do for me, except thyself; and as thou seest he has got me by the throat (for <i>Eugenius</i> could scarce hear me speak across the table), and that I am no match for him in the open field, had I not better, whilst these few scatter’d spirits remain, and these two spider legs of mine (holding one of them up to him) are able to support me⁠—had I not better, <i>Eugenius</i>, fly for my life? ’Tis my advice, my dear <i>Tristram</i>, said <i>Eugenius</i>⁠—Then by heaven! I will lead him a dance he little thinks of⁠⸺⁠for I will gallop, quoth I, without looking once behind me, to the banks of the <i>Garonne</i>; and if I hear him clattering at my heels⁠⸺⁠I’ll scamper away to mount <i>Vesuvius</i>⁠⸺⁠from thence to <i>Joppa</i>, and from <i>Joppa</i> to the world’s end; where, if he follows me, I pray God he may break his neck⁠⸺⁠</p>
			<p>—He runs more risk <em>there</em>, said <i>Eugenius</i>, than thou.</p>
			<p><i>Eugenius’s</i> wit and affection brought blood into the cheek from whence it had been some months banish’d⁠⸺’twas a vile moment to bid adieu in; he led me to my chaise⁠⸺⁠<i xml:lang="fr">Allons!</i> said I; the postboy gave a crack with his whip⁠⸺⁠off I went like a cannon, and in half a dozen bounds got into <i>Dover</i>.</p>
