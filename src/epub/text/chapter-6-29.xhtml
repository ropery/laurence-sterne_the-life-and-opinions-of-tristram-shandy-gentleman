			<p>I beg the reader will assist me here, to wheel off my uncle <i>Toby’s</i> ordnance behind the scenes,⁠⸺⁠to remove his sentry-box, and clear the theatre, <em>if possible</em>, of horn-works and half moons, and get the rest of his military apparatus out of the way;⁠⸺⁠that done, my dear friend <i>Garrick</i>, we’ll snuff the candles bright,⁠—sweep the stage with a new broom,⁠—draw up the curtain, and exhibit my uncle <i>Toby</i> dressed in a new character, throughout which the world can have no idea how he will act: and yet, if pity be akin to love,⁠—and bravery no alien to it, you have seen enough of my uncle <i>Toby</i> in these, to trace these family likenesses betwixt the two passions (in case there is one) to your heart’s content.</p>
			<p>Vain science! thou assistest us in no case of this kind⁠—and thou puzzlest us in every one.</p>
			<p>There was, Madam, in my uncle <i>Toby</i>, a singleness of heart which misled him so far out of the little serpentine tracks in which things of this nature usually go on; you can⁠—you can have no conception of it: with this, there was a plainness and simplicity of thinking, with such an unmistrusting ignorance of the plies and foldings of the heart of woman;⁠⸺⁠and so naked and defenceless did he stand before you (when a siege was out of his head), that you might have stood behind any one of your serpentine walks, and shot my uncle <i>Toby</i> ten times in a day, through his liver, if nine times in a day, Madam, had not served your purpose.</p>
			<p>With all this, Madam,⁠—and what confounded everything as much on the other hand, my uncle <i>Toby</i> had that unparalleled modesty of nature I once told you of, and which, by the by, stood eternal sentry upon his feelings, that you might as soon⁠⸺⁠But where am I going? these reflections crowd in upon me ten pages at least too soon, and take up that time, which I ought to bestow upon facts.</p>
