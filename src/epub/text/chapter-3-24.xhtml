			<p>Tho’ the shock my uncle <i>Toby</i> received the year after the demolition of <i>Dunkirk</i>, in his affair with widow <i>Wadman</i>, had fixed him in a resolution never more to think of the sex⁠—or of aught which belonged to it;⁠—yet corporal <i>Trim</i> had made no such bargain with himself. Indeed in my uncle <i>Toby’s</i> case there was a strange and unaccountable concurrence of circumstances, which insensibly drew him in, to lay siege to that fair and strong citadel.⁠⸺⁠In <i>Trim’s</i> case there was a concurrence of nothing in the world, but of him and <i>Bridget</i> in the kitchen;⁠—though in truth, the love and veneration he bore his master was such, and so fond was he of imitating him in all he did, that had my uncle <i>Toby</i> employed his time and genius in tagging of points⁠⸺⁠I am persuaded the honest corporal would have laid down his arms, and followed his example with pleasure. When therefore my uncle <i>Toby</i> sat down before the mistress⁠—corporal <i>Trim</i> incontinently took ground before the maid.</p>
			<p>Now, my dear friend <i>Garrick</i>, whom I have so much cause to esteem and honour⁠—(why, or wherefore, ’tis no matter)⁠—can it escape your penetration⁠—I defy it⁠—that so many playwrights, and opificers of chitchat have ever since been working upon <i>Trim’s</i> and my uncle <i>Toby’s</i> pattern.⁠⸺⁠I care not what <i>Aristotle</i>, or <i>Pacuvius</i>, or <i>Bossu</i>, or <i>Ricaboni</i> say⁠—(though I never read one of them)⁠⸺⁠there is not a greater difference between a single-horse chair and madam <i>Pompadour’s</i> vis-à-vis; than betwixt a single amour, and an amour thus nobly doubled, and going upon all four, prancing throughout a grand drama⁠⸺⁠Sir, a simple, single, silly affair of that kind⁠—is quite lost in five acts;⁠—but that is neither here nor there.</p>
			<p>After a series of attacks and repulses in a course of nine months on my uncle <i>Toby’s</i> quarter, a most minute account of every particular of which shall be given in its proper place, my uncle <i>Toby</i>, honest man! found it necessary to draw off his forces and raise the siege somewhat indignantly.</p>
			<p>Corporal <i>Trim</i>, as I said, had made no such bargain either with himself⁠⸺⁠or with anyone else⁠⸺⁠the fidelity however of his heart not suffering him to go into a house which his master had forsaken with disgust⁠⸺⁠he contented himself with turning his part of the siege into a blockade;⁠—that is, he kept others off;⁠—for though he never after went to the house, yet he never met <i>Bridget</i> in the village, but he would either nod or wink, or smile, or look kindly at her⁠—or (as circumstances directed) he would shake her by the hand⁠—or ask her lovingly how she did⁠—or would give her a ribbon⁠—and now-and-then, though never but when it could be done with decorum, would give <i>Bridget</i> a⁠—</p>
			<p>Precisely in this situation, did these things stand for five years; that is, from the demolition of <i>Dunkirk</i> in the year 13, to the latter end of my uncle <i>Toby’s</i> campaign in the year 18, which was about six or seven weeks before the time I’m speaking of.⁠⸺⁠When <i>Trim</i>, as his custom was, after he had put my uncle <i>Toby</i> to bed, going down one moonshiny night to see that everything was right at his fortifications⁠⸺⁠in the lane separated from the bowling-green with flowering shrubs and holly⁠—he espied his <i>Bridget</i>.</p>
			<p>As the corporal thought there was nothing in the world so well worth showing as the glorious works which he and my uncle <i>Toby</i> had made, <i>Trim</i> courteously and gallantly took her by the hand, and led her in: this was not done so privately, but that the foul-mouth’d trumpet of Fame carried it from ear to ear, till at length it reach’d my father’s, with this untoward circumstance along with it, that my uncle <i>Toby’s</i> curious drawbridge, constructed and painted after the <i>Dutch</i> fashion, and which went quite across the ditch⁠—was broke down, and somehow or other crushed all to pieces that very night.</p>
			<p>My father, as you have observed, had no great esteem for my uncle <i>Toby’s</i> hobbyhorse, he thought it the most ridiculous horse that ever gentleman mounted; and indeed unless my uncle <i>Toby</i> vexed him about it, could never think of it once, without smiling at it⁠⸺⁠so that it could never get lame or happen any mischance, but it tickled my father’s imagination beyond measure; but this being an accident much more to his humour than any one which had yet befall’n it, it proved an inexhaustible fund of entertainment to him.⁠⸺⁠Well⁠⸺⁠but dear <i>Toby!</i> my father would say, do tell me seriously how this affair of the bridge happened.⁠⸺⁠How can you tease me so much about it? my uncle <i>Toby</i> would reply⁠—I have told it you twenty times, word for word as <i>Trim</i> told it me.⁠—Prithee, how was it then, corporal? my father would cry, turning to <i>Trim</i>.⁠—It was a mere misfortune, an’ please your honour;⁠⸺⁠I was showing <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> <i>Bridget</i> our fortifications, and in going too near the edge of the fosse, I unfortunately slipp’d in⁠⸺⁠Very well, <i>Trim!</i> my father would cry⁠⸺(smiling mysteriously, and giving a nod⁠—but without interrupting him)⁠⸺⁠and being link’d fast, an’ please your honour, arm in arm with <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> <i>Bridget</i>, I dragg’d her after me, by means of which she fell backwards soss against the bridge⁠⸺⁠and <i>Trim’s</i> foot (my uncle <i>Toby</i> would cry, taking the story out of his mouth) getting into the cuvette, he tumbled full against the bridge too.⁠—It was a thousand to one, my uncle <i>Toby</i> would add, that the poor fellow did not break his leg.⁠⸻Ay truly, my father would say⁠⸺⁠a limb is soon broke, brother <i>Toby</i>, in such encounters.⁠⸺⁠And so, an’ please your honour, the bridge, which your honour knows was a very slight one, was broke down betwixt us, and splintered all to pieces.</p>
			<p>At other times, but especially when my uncle <i>Toby</i> was so unfortunate as to say a syllable about cannons, bombs, or petards⁠—my father would exhaust all the stores of his eloquence (which indeed were very great) in a panegyric upon the <b>battering-rams</b> of the ancients⁠—the <b>vinea</b> which <i>Alexander</i> made use of at the siege of <i>Troy</i>.⁠—He would tell my uncle <i>Toby</i> of the <b>catapultæ</b> of the <i>Syrians</i>, which threw such monstrous stones so many hundred feet, and shook the strongest bulwarks from their very foundation:⁠—he would go on and describe the wonderful mechanism of the <b>ballista</b> which <i>Marcellinus</i> makes so much rout about!⁠—the terrible effects of the <b>pyroboli</b>, which cast fire;⁠⸺⁠the danger of the <b>terebra</b> and <b>scorpio</b>, which cast javelins.⁠⸺⁠But what are these, would he say, to the destructive machinery of corporal <i>Trim?</i>⁠⸺⁠Believe me, brother <i>Toby</i>, no bridge, or bastion, or sally-port, that ever was constructed in this world, can hold out against such artillery.</p>
			<p>My uncle <i>Toby</i> would never attempt any defence against the force of this ridicule, but that of redoubling the vehemence of smoaking his pipe; in doing which, he raised so dense a vapour one night after supper, that it set my father, who was a little phthisical, into a suffocating fit of violent coughing: my uncle <i>Toby</i> leap’d up without feeling the pain upon his groin⁠—and, with infinite pity, stood beside his brother’s chair, tapping his back with one hand, and holding his head with the other, and from time to time wiping his eyes with a clean cambrick handkerchief, which he pulled out of his pocket.⁠⸺⁠The affectionate and endearing manner in which my uncle <i>Toby</i> did these little offices⁠—cut my father thro’ his reins, for the pain he had just been giving him.⁠⸺⁠May my brains be knock’d out with a battering-ram or a catapulta, I care not which, quoth my father to himself⁠—if ever I insult this worthy soul more!</p>
