			<p>Now as widow <i>Wadman</i> did love my uncle <i>Toby</i>⁠⸺⁠and my uncle <i>Toby</i> did not love widow <i>Wadman</i>, there was nothing for widow <i>Wadman</i> to do, but to go on and love my uncle <i>Toby</i>⁠⸺⁠or let it alone.</p>
			<p>Widow <i>Wadman</i> would do neither the one or the other.</p>
			<p>⸺⁠Gracious heaven!⁠⸺⁠but I forget I am a little of her temper myself; for whenever it so falls out, which it sometimes does about the equinoxes, that an earthly goddess is so much this, and that, and t’other, that I cannot eat my breakfast for her⁠⸺⁠and that she careth not three halfpence whether I eat my breakfast or no⁠⸺⁠</p>
			<p>⸺⁠Curse on her! and so I send her to <i>Tartary</i>, and from <i>Tartary</i> to <i>Terra del Fuogo</i>, and so on to the devil: in short, there is not an infernal nitch where I do not take her divinityship and stick it.</p>
			<p>But as the heart is tender, and the passions in these tides ebb and flow ten times in a minute, I instantly bring her back again; and as I do all things in extremes, I place her in the very centre of the milky-way⁠⸺⁠</p>
			<p>Brightest of stars! thou wilt shed thy influence upon someone⁠⸻</p>
			<p>⸺⁠The duce take her and her influence too⁠⸺⁠for at that word I lose all patience⁠⸺⁠much good may it do him!⁠⸺⁠By all that is hirsute and gashly! I cry, taking off my furr’d cap, and twisting it round my finger⁠⸺⁠I would not give sixpence for a dozen such!</p>
			<p>⸺⁠But ’tis an excellent cap too (putting it upon my head, and pressing it close to my ears)⁠—and warm⁠—and soft; especially if you stroke it the right way⁠—but alas! that will never be my luck⁠⸺(so here my philosophy is shipwreck’d again).</p>
			<p>⸺⁠No; I shall never have a finger in the pye (so here I break my metaphor)⁠⸺⁠</p>
			<p>Crust and Crumb</p>
			<p>Inside and out</p>
			<p>Top and bottom⁠⸺⁠I detest it, I hate it, I repudiate it⁠⸺⁠I’m sick at the sight of it⁠⸺⁠</p>
			<p>’Tis all pepper,</p>
			<p class="followon">garlick,</p>
			<p class="followon">staragen,</p>
			<p class="followon">salt, and</p>
			<p class="followon">devil’s dung⁠⸺⁠by the great arch-cook of cooks, who does nothing, I think, from morning to night, but sit down by the fireside and invent inflammatory dishes for us, I would not touch it for the world⁠⸺⁠</p>
			<p>⸺⁠<em>O Tristram! Tristram!</em> cried <i>Jenny</i>.</p>
			<p><em>O Jenny! Jenny!</em> replied I, and so went on with the twelfth chapter.</p>
