			<p>Your honour, said <i>Trim</i>, shutting the parlour-door before he began to speak, has heard, I imagine, of this unlucky accident⁠⸺⁠O yes, <i>Trim</i>, said my uncle <i>Toby</i>, and it gives me great concern.⁠—I am heartily concerned too, but I hope your honour, replied <i>Trim</i>, will do me the justice to believe, that it was not in the least owing to me.⁠⸺⁠To thee⁠—<i>Trim?</i>⁠—cried my uncle <i>Toby</i>, looking kindly in his face⁠⸻’twas <i>Susannah’s</i> and the curate’s folly betwixt them.⁠⸻What business could they have together, an’ please your honour, in the garden?⁠⸺⁠In the gallery thou meanest, replied my uncle <i>Toby</i>.</p>
			<p><i>Trim</i> found he was upon a wrong scent, and stopped short with a low bow⁠⸺⁠Two misfortunes, quoth the corporal to himself, are twice as many at least as are needful to be talked over at one time;⁠⸺⁠the mischief the cow has done in breaking into the fortifications, may be told his honour hereafter.⁠⸺⁠<i>Trim’s</i> casuistry and address, under the cover of his low bow, prevented all suspicion in my uncle <i>Toby</i>, so he went on with what he had to say to <i>Trim</i> as follows:</p>
			<p>⸻For my own part, <i>Trim</i>, though I can see little or no difference betwixt my nephew’s being called <i>Tristram</i> or <i>Trismegistus</i>⁠—yet as the thing sits so near my brother’s heart, <i>Trim</i>⁠⸻I would freely have given a hundred pounds rather than it should have happened.⁠⸺⁠A hundred pounds, an’ please your honour! replied <i>Trim</i>,⁠⸺⁠I would not give a cherrystone to boot.⁠⸺⁠Nor would I, <i>Trim</i>, upon my own account, quoth my uncle <i>Toby</i>,⁠⸺⸺⁠but my brother, whom there is no arguing with in this case⁠—maintains that a great deal more depends, <i>Trim</i>, upon christian-names, than what ignorant people imagine⁠⸺⁠for he says there never was a great or heroic action performed since the world began by one called <i>Tristram</i>⁠—nay, he will have it, <i>Trim</i>, that a man can neither be learned, or wise, or brave.⁠⸺’Tis all fancy, an’ please your honour⁠—I fought just as well, replied the corporal, when the regiment called me <i>Trim</i>, as when they called me <i>James Butler</i>.⁠⸺⁠And for my own part, said my uncle <i>Toby</i>, though I should blush to boast of myself, <i>Trim</i>⁠⸺⁠yet had my name been <i>Alexander</i>, I could have done no more at <i>Namur</i> than my duty.⁠—Bless your honour! cried <i>Trim</i>, advancing three steps as he spoke, does a man think of his christian-name when he goes upon the attack?⁠⸻Or when he stands in the trench, <i>Trim?</i> cried my uncle <i>Toby</i>, looking firm.⁠⸺⁠Or when he enters a breach? said <i>Trim</i>, pushing in between two chairs.⁠⸺⁠Or forces the lines? cried my uncle, rising up, and pushing his crutch like a pike.⁠⸺⁠Or facing a platoon? cried <i>Trim</i>, presenting his stick like a firelock.⁠⸺⁠Or when he marches up the glacis? cried my uncle <i>Toby</i>, looking warm and setting his foot upon his stool.⁠⸻</p>
