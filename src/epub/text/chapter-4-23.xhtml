			<p>—But can the thing be undone, <i>Yorick?</i> said my father⁠—for in my opinion, continued he, it cannot. I am a vile canonist, replied <i>Yorick</i>⁠—but of all evils, holding suspense to be the most tormenting, we shall at least know the worst of this matter. I hate these great dinners⁠⸺⁠said my father⁠—The size of the dinner is not the point, answered <i>Yorick</i>⁠⸺⁠we want, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> <i>Shandy</i>, to dive into the bottom of this doubt, whether the name can be changed or not⁠—and as the beards of so many commissaries, officials, advocates, proctors, registers, and of the most eminent of our school-divines, and others, are all to meet in the middle of one table, and <i>Didius</i> has so pressingly invited you⁠—who in your distress would miss such an occasion? All that is requisite, continued <i>Yorick</i>, is to apprize <i>Didius</i>, and let him manage a conversation after dinner so as to introduce the subject.⁠—Then my brother <i>Toby</i>, cried my father, clapping his two hands together, shall go with us.</p>

			<p>⸺⁠Let my old tye-wig, quoth my uncle <i>Toby</i>, and my laced regimentals, be hung to the fire all night, <i>Trim</i>.</p>
