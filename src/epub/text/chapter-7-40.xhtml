			<p>As I knew the geography of the Tomb of the Lovers, as well as if I had lived twenty years in <i>Lyons</i>, namely, that it was upon the turning of my right hand, just without the gate, leading to the <i>Fauxbourg de Vaise</i>⁠⸺⁠I dispatched <i>François</i> to the boat, that I might pay the homage I so long ow’d it, without a witness of my weakness⁠—I walk’d with all imaginable joy towards the place⁠⸺⁠when I saw the gate which intercepted the tomb, my heart glowed within me⁠⸺⁠</p>
			<p>—Tender and faithful spirits! cried I, addressing myself to <i>Amandus</i> and <i>Amanda</i>⁠—long⁠—long have I tarried to drop this tear upon your tomb⁠⸻I come⁠⸻I come⁠⸻</p>
			<p>When I came⁠—there was no tomb to drop it upon.</p>
			<p>What would I have given for my uncle <i>Toby</i>, to have whistled Lillabullero!</p>
