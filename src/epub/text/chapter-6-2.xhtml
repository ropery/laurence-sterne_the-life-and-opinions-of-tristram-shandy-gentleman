			<p>When my father had danced his white bear backwards and forwards through half a dozen pages, he closed the book for good an’ all,⁠—and in a kind of triumph redelivered it into <i>Trim’s</i> hand, with a nod to lay it upon the ’scrutoire, where he found it.⁠⸺⁠<i>Tristram</i>, said he, shall be made to conjugate every word in the dictionary, backwards and forwards the same way;⁠⸺⁠every word, <i>Yorick</i>, by this means, you see, is converted into a thesis or an hypothesis;⁠—every thesis and hypothesis have an offspring of propositions;⁠—and each proposition has its own consequences and conclusions; every one of which leads the mind on again, into fresh tracks of enquiries and doubtings.⁠⸺⁠The force of this engine, added my father, is incredible in opening a child’s head.⁠⸺’Tis enough, brother <i>Shandy</i>, cried my uncle <i>Toby</i>, to burst it into a thousand splinters.⁠⸺⁠</p>
			<p>I presume, said <i>Yorick</i>, smiling,⁠—it must be owing to this,⁠⸺(for let logicians say what they will, it is not to be accounted for sufficiently from the bare use of the ten predicaments)⁠⸺⁠That the famous <i>Vincent Quirino</i>, amongst the many other astonishing feats of his childhood, of which the Cardinal <i>Bembo</i> has given the world so exact a story,⁠—should be able to paste up in the public schools at <i>Rome</i>, so early as in the eighth year of his age, no less than four thousand five hundred and fifty different theses, upon the most abstruse points of the most abstruse theology;⁠—and to defend and maintain them in such sort, as to cramp and dumbfound his opponents.⁠⸺⁠What is that, cried my father, to what is told us of <i>Alphonsus Tostatus</i>, who, almost in his nurse’s arms, learned all the sciences and liberal arts without being taught any one of them?⁠⸺⁠What shall we say of the great <i>Piereskius?</i>⁠—That’s the very man, cried my uncle <i>Toby</i>, I once told you of, brother <i>Shandy</i>, who walked a matter of five hundred miles, reckoning from <i>Paris</i> to <i>Shevling</i>, and from <i>Shevling</i> back again, merely to see <i>Stevinus’s</i> flying chariot.⁠⸺⁠He was a very great man! added my uncle <i>Toby</i> (meaning <i>Stevinus</i>)⁠—He was so, brother <i>Toby</i>, said my father (meaning <i>Piereskius</i>)⁠⸺⁠and had multiplied his ideas so fast, and increased his knowledge to such a prodigious stock, that, if we may give credit to an anecdote concerning him, which we cannot withhold here, without shaking the authority of all anecdotes whatever⁠—at seven years of age, his father committed entirely to his care the education of his younger brother, a boy of five years old,⁠—with the sole management of all his concerns.⁠—Was the father as wise as the son? quoth my uncle <i>Toby</i>:⁠—I should think not, said <i>Yorick</i>:⁠—But what are these, continued my father⁠—(breaking out in a kind of enthusiasm)⁠—what are these, to those prodigies of childhood in <i>Grotius</i>, <i>Scioppius</i>, <i>Heinsius</i>, <i>Politian</i>, <i>Pascal</i>, <i>Joseph Scaliger</i>, <i>Ferdinand de Cordouè</i>, and others⁠—some of which left off their <em>substantial forms</em> at nine years old, or sooner, and went on reasoning without them;⁠—others went through their classics at seven;⁠—wrote tragedies at eight;⁠—<i>Ferdinand de Cordouè</i> was so wise at nine,⁠—’twas thought the Devil was in him;⁠—and at <i>Venice</i> gave such proofs of his knowledge and goodness, that the monks imagined he was <i>Antichrist</i>, or nothing.⁠⸺⁠Others were masters of fourteen languages at ten,⁠—finished the course of their rhetoric, poetry, logic, and ethics, at eleven,⁠—put forth their commentaries upon <i>Servius</i> and <i>Martianus Capella</i> at twelve,⁠—and at thirteen received their degrees in philosophy, laws, and divinity:⁠⸺⁠But you forget the great <i>Lipsius</i>, quoth <i>Yorick</i>, who composed a work<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-27" id="noteref-27" epub:type="noteref">27</a> the day he was born:⁠⸺⁠They should have wiped it up, said my uncle <i>Toby</i>, and said no more about it.</p>
