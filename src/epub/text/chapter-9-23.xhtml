			<p><abbr>Mrs.</abbr> <i>Bridget</i> had pawn’d all the little stock of honour a poor chambermaid was worth in the world, that she would get to the bottom of the affair in ten days; and it was built upon one of the most concessible postulata in nature: namely, that whilst my uncle <i>Toby</i> was making love to her mistress, the corporal could find nothing better to do, than make love to her⁠⸺“<em>And I’ll let him as much as he will</em>, said <i>Bridget</i>, <em>to get it out of him</em>.”</p>
			<p>Friendship has two garments; an outer and an under one. <i>Bridget</i> was serving her mistress’s interests in the one⁠—and doing the thing which most pleased herself in the other; so had as many stakes depending upon my uncle <i>Toby’s</i> wound, as the Devil himself⁠⸺⁠<abbr>Mrs.</abbr> <i>Wadman</i> had but one⁠—and as it possibly might be her last (without discouraging <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> <i>Bridget</i>, or discrediting her talents) was determined to play her cards herself.</p>
			<p>She wanted not encouragement: a child might have look’d into his hand⁠⸺⁠there was such a plainness and simplicity in his playing out what trumps he had⁠⸺⁠with such an unmistrusting ignorance of the <em>ten-ace</em>⁠⸺⁠and so naked and defenceless did he sit upon the same sofa with widow <i>Wadman</i>, that a generous heart would have wept to have won the game of him.</p>
			<p>Let us drop the metaphor.</p>
