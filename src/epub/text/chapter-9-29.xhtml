			<p>It was like the momentary contest in the moist eyelids of an <i>April</i> morning, “Whether <i>Bridget</i> should laugh or cry.”</p>
			<p>She snatched up a rolling-pin⁠⸺’twas ten to one, she had laugh’d⁠⸺⁠</p>
			<p>She laid it down⁠⸺⁠she cried; and had one single tear of ’em but tasted of bitterness, full sorrowful would the corporal’s heart have been that he had used the argument; but the corporal understood the sex, a <em>quart major to a terce</em> at least, better than my uncle <i>Toby</i>, and accordingly he assailed <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> <i>Bridget</i> after this manner.</p>
			<p>I know, <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> <i>Bridget</i>, said the corporal, giving her a most respectful kiss, that thou art good and modest by nature, and art withal so generous a girl in thyself, that, if I know thee rightly, thou would’st not wound an insect, much less the honour of so gallant and worthy a soul as my master, wast thou sure to be made a countess of⁠⸺⁠but thou hast been set on, and deluded, dear <i>Bridget</i>, as is often a woman’s case, “to please others more than themselves⁠⸺”</p>
			<p><i>Bridget’s</i> eyes poured down at the sensations the corporal excited.</p>
			<p>⸺⁠Tell me⁠⸺⁠tell me, then, my dear <i>Bridget</i>, continued the corporal, taking hold of her hand, which hung down dead by her side,⁠⸺⁠and, giving a second kiss⁠⸺⁠whose suspicion has misled thee?</p>
			<p><i>Bridget</i> sobb’d a sob or two⁠⸺⁠then open’d her eyes⁠⸺⁠the corporal wiped ’em with the bottom of her apron⁠⸺⁠she then open’d her heart and told him all.</p>
