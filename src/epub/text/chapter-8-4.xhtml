			<p>“It is with Love as with Cuckoldom”⁠⸺⁠the suffering party is at least the <em>third</em>, but generally the last in the house who knows anything about the matter: this comes, as all the world knows, from having half a dozen words for one thing; and so long, as what in this vessel of the human frame, is <em>Love</em>⁠—may be <em>Hatred</em>, in that⁠⸺⁠<em>Sentiment</em> half a yard higher⁠⸺⁠and <em>Nonsense</em>⁠⸺⁠⸻no, Madam,⁠—not there⁠⸺⁠I mean at the part I am now pointing to with my forefinger⁠⸺⁠how can we help ourselves?</p>
			<p>Of all mortal, and immortal men too, if you please, who ever soliloquized upon this mystic subject, my uncle <i>Toby</i> was the worst fitted, to have push’d his researches, thro’ such a contention of feelings; and he had infallibly let them all run on, as we do worse matters, to see what they would turn out⁠⸺⁠had not <i>Bridget’s</i> pre-notification of them to <i>Susannah</i>, and <i>Susannah’s</i> repeated manifestoes thereupon to all the world, made it necessary for my uncle <i>Toby</i> to look into the affair.</p>
