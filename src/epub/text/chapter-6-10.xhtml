			</hgroup>
			<p>The sun looked bright the morning after, to every eye in the village but <i>Le Fever’s</i> and his afflicted son’s; the hand of death press’d heavy upon his eyelids,⁠⸺⁠and hardly could the wheel at the cistern turn round its circle,⁠—when my uncle <i>Toby</i>, who had rose up an hour before his wonted time, entered the lieutenant’s room, and without preface or apology, sat himself down upon the chair by the bedside, and, independently of all modes and customs, opened the curtain in the manner an old friend and brother officer would have done it, and asked him how he did,⁠—how he had rested in the night,⁠—what was his complaint,⁠—where was his pain,⁠—and what he could do to help him:⁠⸺⁠and without giving him time to answer any one of the enquiries, went on, and told him of the little plan which he had been concerting with the corporal the night before for him.⁠⸺⁠</p>
			<p>⸺⁠You shall go home directly, <i>Le Fever</i>, said my uncle <i>Toby</i>, to my house,⁠—and we’ll send for a doctor to see what’s the matter,⁠—and we’ll have an apothecary,⁠—and the corporal shall be your nurse;⁠⸺⁠and I’ll be your servant, <i>Le Fever</i>.</p>
			<p>There was a frankness in my uncle <i>Toby</i>,⁠—not the <em>effect</em> of familiarity,⁠—but the <em>cause</em> of it,⁠—which let you at once into his soul, and showed you the goodness of his nature; to this, there was something in his looks, and voice, and manner, superadded, which eternally beckoned to the unfortunate to come and take shelter under him; so that before my uncle <i>Toby</i> had half finished the kind offers he was making to the father, had the son insensibly pressed up close to his knees, and had taken hold of the breast of his coat, and was pulling it towards him.⁠⸺⁠The blood and spirits of <i>Le Fever</i>, which were waxing cold and slow within him, and were retreating to their last citadel, the heart⁠—rallied back,⁠—the film forsook his eyes for a moment,⁠—he looked up wishfully in my uncle <i>Toby’s</i> face,⁠—then cast a look upon his boy,⁠⸺⁠and that <em>ligament</em>, fine as it was,⁠—was never broken.⁠⸻</p>
			<p>Nature instantly ebb’d again,⁠—the film returned to its place,⁠⸺⁠the pulse fluttered⁠⸺⁠stopp’d⁠⸺⁠went on⁠⸺⁠throbb’d⁠⸺⁠stopp’d again⁠⸺⁠moved⁠⸺⁠stopp’d⁠⸺⁠shall I go on?⁠⸺⁠No.</p>
