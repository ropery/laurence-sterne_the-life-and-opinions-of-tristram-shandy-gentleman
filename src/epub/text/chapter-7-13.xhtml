			<p>“<em>Make them like unto a wheel</em>,” is a bitter sarcasm, as all the learned know, against the grand tour, and that restless spirit for making it, which <i>David</i> prophetically foresaw would haunt the children of men in the latter days; and therefore, as thinketh the great bishop <i>Hall</i>, ’tis one of the severest imprecations which <i>David</i> ever utter’d against the enemies of the Lord⁠—and, as if he had said, “I wish them no worse luck than always to be rolling about”⁠—So much motion, continues he (for he was very corpulent)⁠—is so much unquietness; and so much of rest, by the same analogy, is so much of heaven.</p>
			<p>Now, I (being very thin) think differently; and that so much of motion, is so much of life, and so much of joy⁠⸺⁠and that to stand still, or get on but slowly, is death and the devil⁠⸺⁠</p>
			<p>Hollo! Ho!⁠⸺⁠the whole world’s asleep!⁠⸺⁠bring out the horses⁠⸺⁠grease the wheels⁠—tie on the mail⁠⸺⁠and drive a nail into that moulding⁠⸺⁠I’ll not lose a moment⁠⸺⁠</p>
			<p>Now the wheel we are talking of, and <em>whereinto</em> (but not <em>whereunto</em>, for that would make an Ixion’s wheel of it) he curseth his enemies, according to the bishop’s habit of body, should certainly be a post-chaise wheel, whether they were set up in <i>Palestine</i> at that time or not⁠⸺⁠and my wheel, for the contrary reasons, must as certainly be a cartwheel groaning round its revolution once in an age; and of which sort, were I to turn commentator, I should make no scruple to affirm, they had great store in that hilly country.</p>
			<p>I love the Pythagoreans (much more than ever I dare tell my dear <i>Jenny</i>) for their “<span xml:lang="el">χωρισμὸν ἀπὸ τοῦ Σώματος, εἰς τὸ καλῶς φιλοσοφεῖν</span>”⁠⸺[their] “<i>getting out of the body, in order to think well.</i>” No man thinks right, whilst he is in it; blinded as he must be, with his congenial humours, and drawn differently aside, as the bishop and myself have been, with too lax or too tense a fibre⁠⸺⁠<b>Reason</b> is, half of it, <b>Sense</b>; and the measure of heaven itself is but the measure of our present appetites and concoctions⁠⸺⁠</p>
			<p>⸺⁠But which of the two, in the present case, do you think to be mostly in the wrong?</p>
			<p>You, certainly: quoth she, to disturb a whole family so early.</p>
