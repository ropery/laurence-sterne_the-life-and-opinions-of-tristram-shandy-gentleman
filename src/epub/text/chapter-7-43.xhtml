				<p>I had not gone above two leagues and a half, before the man with his gun began to look at his priming.</p>
				<p>I had three several times loiter’d <em>terribly</em> behind; half a mile at least every time; once, in deep conference with a drum-maker, who was making drums for the fairs of <i>Baucaira</i> and <i>Tarascone</i>⁠—I did not understand the principles⁠⸺⁠</p>
				<p>The second time, I cannot so properly say, I stopp’d⁠⸺⁠for meeting a couple of <i>Franciscans</i> straitened more for time than myself, and not being able to get to the bottom of what I was about⁠⸺⁠I had turn’d back with them⁠⸺⁠</p>
				<p>The third, was an affair of trade with a gossip, for a hand-basket of <i>Provence</i> figs for four sous; this would have been transacted at once; but for a case of conscience at the close of it; for when the figs were paid for, it turn’d out, that there were two dozen of eggs cover’d over with vine-leaves at the bottom of the basket⁠—as I had no intention of buying eggs⁠—I made no sort of claim of them⁠—as for the space they had occupied⁠—what signified it? I had figs enow for my money⁠⸺⁠</p>
				<p>—But it was my intention to have the basket⁠—it was the gossip’s intention to keep it, without which, she could do nothing with her eggs⁠⸺⁠and unless I had the basket, I could do as little with my figs, which were too ripe already, and most of ’em burst at the side: this brought on a short contention, which terminated in sundry proposals, what we should both do⁠⸺⁠</p>
				<p>⸺⁠How we disposed of our eggs and figs, I defy you, or the Devil himself, had he not been there (which I am persuaded he was), to form the least probable conjecture: You will read the whole of it⁠⸻not this year, for I am hastening to the story of my uncle <i>Toby’s</i> amours⁠—but you will read it in the collection of those which have arose out of the journey across this plain⁠—and which, therefore, I call my</p>
				<blockquote>
					<p>plain stories.</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>How far my pen has been fatigued, like those of other travellers, in this journey of it, over so barren a track⁠—the world must judge⁠—but the traces of it, which are now all set o’ vibrating together this moment, tell me ’tis the most fruitful and busy period of my life; for as I had made no convention with my man with the gun, as to time⁠—by stopping and talking to every soul I met, who was not in a full trot⁠—joining all parties before me⁠—waiting for every soul behind⁠—hailing all those who were coming through crossroads⁠—arresting all kinds of beggars, pilgrims, fiddlers, friars⁠⸺⁠not passing by a woman in a mulberry-tree without commending her legs, and tempting her into conversation with a pinch of snuff⁠⸻In short, by seizing every handle, of what size or shape soever, which chance held out to me in this journey⁠—I turned my <em>plain</em> into a <em>city</em>⁠—I was always in company, and with great variety too; and as my mule loved society as much as myself, and had some proposals always on his part to offer to every beast he met⁠—I am confident we could have passed through <i>Pall-Mall</i>, or <abbr>St.</abbr> <i>James’s</i>-Street for a month together, with fewer adventures⁠—and seen less of human nature.</p>
				<p>O! there is that sprightly frankness, which at once unpins every plait of a <i>Languedocian’s</i> dress⁠—that whatever is beneath it, it looks so like the simplicity which poets sing of in better days⁠—I will delude my fancy, and believe it is so.</p>
				<p>’Twas in the road betwixt <i>Nismes</i> and <i>Lunel</i>, where there is the best <i>Muscatto</i> wine in all <i>France</i>, and which by the by belongs to the honest canons of <b>Montpellier</b>⁠—and foul befal the man who has drank it at their table, who grudges them a drop of it.</p>
				<p>⸺⁠The sun was set⁠—they had done their work; the nymphs had tied up their hair afresh⁠—and the swains were preparing for a carousal⁠⸺⁠my mule made a dead point⁠⸺’Tis the fife and tabourin, said I⁠⸺⁠I’m frighten’d to death, quoth he⁠⸺⁠They are running at the ring of pleasure, said I, giving him a prick⁠⸺⁠By saint <i>Boogar</i>, and all the saints at the backside of the door of purgatory, said he⁠—(making the same resolution with the abbesse of <i>Andoüillets</i>) I’ll not go a step further⁠⸻’Tis very well, sir, said I⁠⸺⁠I never will argue a point with one of your family, as long as I live; so leaping off his back, and kicking off one boot into this ditch, and t’other into that⁠—I’ll take a dance, said I⁠—so stay you here.</p>
				<p>A sunburnt daughter of Labour rose up from the groupe to meet me, as I advanced towards them; her hair, which was a dark chesnut approaching rather to a black, was tied up in a knot, all but a single tress.</p>
				<p>We want a cavalier, said she, holding out both her hands, as if to offer them⁠—And a cavalier ye shall have; said I, taking hold of both of them.</p>
				<p>Hadst thou, <i>Nannette</i>, been array’d like a dutchesse!</p>
				<p>⸺⁠But that cursed slit in thy petticoat!</p>
				<p><i>Nannette</i> cared not for it.</p>
				<p>We could not have done without you, said she, letting go one hand, with self-taught politeness, leading me up with the other.</p>
				<p>A lame youth, whom <i>Apollo</i> had recompensed with a pipe, and to which he had added a tabourin of his own accord, ran sweetly over the prelude, as he sat upon the bank⁠⸺⁠Tie me up this tress instantly, said <i>Nannette</i>, putting a piece of string into my hand⁠—It taught me to forget I was a stranger⁠⸺⁠The whole knot fell down⁠⸺⁠We had been seven years acquainted.</p>
				<p>The youth struck the note upon the tabourin⁠—his pipe followed, and off we bounded⁠⸺“the duce take that slit!”</p>
				<p>The sister of the youth, who had stolen her voice from heaven, sung alternately with her brother⁠⸺’twas a <i>Gascoigne</i> roundelay.</p>
				<blockquote epub:type="z3998:song">
					<p>
						<span class="i2">Viva la joia!</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i2">Fidon la Tristessa!</span>
					</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>The nymphs join’d in unison, and their swains an octave below them⁠⸺⁠</p>
				<p>I would have given a crown to have it sew’d up⁠—<i>Nannette</i> would not have given a <b>sous</b>⁠—<i xml:lang="fr">Viva la joia!</i> was in her lips⁠—<i xml:lang="fr">Viva la joia!</i> was in her eyes. A transient spark of amity shot across the space betwixt us⁠⸺⁠She look’d amiable!⁠⸺⁠Why could I not live, and end my days thus? Just Disposer of our joys and sorrows, cried I, why could not a man sit down in the lap of content here⁠⸺⁠and dance, and sing, and say his prayers, and go to heaven with this nut-brown maid? Capriciously did she bend her head on one side, and dance up insidious⁠⸺⁠Then ’tis time to dance off, quoth I; so changing only partners and tunes, I danced it away from <i>Lunel</i> to <i>Montpellier</i>⁠⸺⁠from thence to <i>Pesçnas</i>, <i>Beziers</i>⁠⸺⁠I danced it along through <i>Narbonne</i>, <i>Carcasson</i>, and <i>Castle Naudairy</i>, till at last I danced myself into <i>Perdrillo’s</i> pavillion, where pulling out a paper of black lines, that I might go on straight forwards, without digression or parenthesis, in my uncle <i>Toby’s</i> amours⁠⸺⁠</p>
				<p>I begun thus⁠⸺⁠</p>
