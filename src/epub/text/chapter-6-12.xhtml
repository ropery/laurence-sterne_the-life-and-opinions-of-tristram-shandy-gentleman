			<p>When my uncle <i>Toby</i> had turned everything into money, and settled all accounts betwixt the agent of the regiment and <i>Le Fever</i>, and betwixt <i>Le Fever</i> and all mankind,⁠⸺⁠there remained nothing more in my uncle <i>Toby’s</i> hands, than an old regimental coat and a sword; so that my uncle <i>Toby</i> found little or no opposition from the world in taking administration. The coat my uncle <i>Toby</i> gave the corporal;⁠⸺⁠Wear it, <i>Trim</i>, said my uncle <i>Toby</i>, as long as it will hold together, for the sake of the poor lieutenant⁠⸺⁠And this,⁠⸺⁠said my uncle <i>Toby</i>, taking up the sword in his hand, and drawing it out of the scabbard as he spoke⁠⸺⁠and this, <i>Le Fever</i>, I’ll save for thee,⁠—’tis all the fortune, continued my uncle <i>Toby</i>, hanging it up upon a crook, and pointing to it,⁠—’tis all the fortune, my dear <i>Le Fever</i>, which God has left thee; but if he has given thee a heart to fight thy way with it in the world,⁠—and thou doest it like a man of honour,⁠—’tis enough for us.</p>
			<p>As soon as my uncle <i>Toby</i> had laid a foundation, and taught him to inscribe a regular polygon in a circle, he sent him to a public school, where, excepting <i>Whitsontide</i> and <i>Christmas</i>, at which times the corporal was punctually dispatched for him,⁠—he remained to the spring of the year, seventeen; when the stories of the emperor’s sending his army into <i>Hungary</i> against the <i>Turks</i>, kindling a spark of fire in his bosom, he left his <i>Greek</i> and <i>Latin</i> without leave, and throwing himself upon his knees before my uncle <i>Toby</i>, begged his father’s sword, and my uncle <i>Toby’s</i> leave along with it, to go and try his fortune under <i>Eugene</i>.⁠—Twice did my uncle <i>Toby</i> forget his wound and cry out, <i>Le Fever!</i> I will go with thee, and thou shalt fight beside me⁠⸺⁠And twice he laid his hand upon his groin, and hung down his head in sorrow and disconsolation.⁠⸺⁠</p>
			<p>My uncle <i>Toby</i> took down the sword from the crook, where it had hung untouched ever since the lieutenant’s death, and delivered it to the corporal to brighten up;⁠⸺⁠and having detained <i>Le Fever</i> a single fortnight to equip him, and contract for his passage to <i>Leghorn</i>,⁠—he put the sword into his hand.⁠⸺⁠If thou art brave, <i>Le Fever</i>, said my uncle <i>Toby</i>, this will not fail thee,⁠⸺⁠but Fortune, said he (musing a little),⁠⸺⁠Fortune may⁠⸺⁠And if she does,⁠—added my uncle <i>Toby</i>, embracing him, come back again to me, <i>Le Fever</i>, and we will shape thee another course.</p>
			<p>The greatest injury could not have oppressed the heart of <i>Le Fever</i> more than my uncle <i>Toby’s</i> paternal kindness;⁠⸺⁠he parted from my uncle <i>Toby</i>, as the best of sons from the best of fathers⁠⸺⁠both dropped tears⁠⸺⁠and as my uncle <i>Toby</i> gave him his last kiss, he slipped sixty guineas, tied up in an old purse of his father’s, in which was his mother’s ring, into his hand,⁠⸺⁠and bid God bless him.</p>
