			<p>The whole secret of health, said my father, beginning the sentence again, depending evidently upon the due contention betwixt the radical heat and radical moisture within us;⁠—the least imaginable skill had been sufficient to have maintained it, had not the schoolmen confounded the talk, merely (as <i>Van Helmont</i>, the famous chymist, has proved) by all along mistaking the radical moisture for the tallow and fat of animal bodies.</p>
			<p>Now the radical moisture is not the tallow or fat of animals, but an oily and balsamous substance; for the fat and tallow, as also the phlegm or watery parts, are cold; whereas the oily and balsamous parts are of a lively heat and spirit, which accounts for the observation of <i>Aristotle</i>, “<i xml:lang="la">Quod omne animal post coitum est triste.</i>”</p>
			<p>Now it is certain, that the radical heat lives in the radical moisture, but whether vice versa, is a doubt: however, when the one decays, the other decays also; and then is produced, either an unnatural heat, which causes an unnatural dryness⁠⸺⁠or an unnatural moisture, which causes dropsies.⁠⸺⁠So that if a child, as he grows up, can but be taught to avoid running into fire or water, as either of ’em threaten his destruction,⁠⸺’twill be all that is needful to be done upon that head.⁠⸺⁠</p>
