			<p>It is a great inconvenience to a man in a haste, that there are three distinct roads between <i>Calais</i> and <i>Paris</i>, in behalf of which there is so much to be said by the several deputies from the towns which lie along them, that half a day is easily lost in settling which you’ll take.</p>
			<p>First, the road by <i>Lisle</i> and <i>Arras</i>, which is the most about⁠⸺⁠but most interesting and instructing.</p>
			<p>The second, that by <i>Amiens</i>, which you may go, if you would see <i>Chantilly</i>⁠⸺⁠</p>
			<p>And that by <i>Beauvais</i>, which you may go, if you will.</p>
			<p>For this reason a great many choose to go by <i>Beauvais</i>.</p>
