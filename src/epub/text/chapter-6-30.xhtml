			<p>Of the few legitimate sons of <i>Adam</i> whose breasts never felt what the sting of love was,⁠—(maintaining first, all mysogynists to be bastards)⁠—the greatest heroes of ancient and modern story have carried off amongst them nine parts in ten of the honour; and I wish for their sakes I had the key of my study, out of my draw-well, only for five minutes, to tell you their names⁠—recollect them I cannot⁠—so be content to accept of these, for the present, in their stead.⁠⸻</p>
			<p>There was the great king <i>Aldrovandus</i>, and <i>Bosphorus</i>, and <i>Cappadocius</i>, and <i>Dardanus</i>, and <i>Pontus</i>, and <i>Asius</i>,⁠⸺⁠to say nothing of the iron-hearted <i>Charles</i> the <span epub:type="z3998:roman">XII</span>, whom the Countess of K***** herself could make nothing of.⁠⸺⁠There was <i>Babylonicus</i>, and <i>Mediterraneus</i>, and <i>Polixenes</i>, and <i>Persicus</i>, and <i>Prusicus</i>, not one of whom (except <i>Cappadocius</i> and <i>Pontus</i>, who were both a little suspected) ever once bowed down his breast to the goddess⁠⸺⁠The truth is, they had all of them something else to do⁠—and so had my uncle <i>Toby</i>⁠—till Fate⁠—till Fate I say, envying his name the glory of being handed down to posterity with <i>Aldrovandus’s</i> and the rest,⁠—she basely patched up the peace of <i>Utrecht</i>.</p>
			<p>⸺⁠Believe me, Sirs, ’twas the worst deed she did that year.</p>
