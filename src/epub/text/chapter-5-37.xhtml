			<p>The description of the siege of <i>Jericho</i> itself, could not have engaged the attention of my uncle <i>Toby</i> more powerfully than the last chapter;⁠—his eyes were fixed upon my father throughout it;⁠—he never mentioned radical heat and radical moisture, but my uncle <i>Toby</i> took his pipe out of his mouth, and shook his head; and as soon as the chapter was finished, he beckoned to the corporal to come close to his chair, to ask him the following question,⁠—<em>aside</em>.⁠⸺⁠<span>*</span> <span>*</span> <span>*</span> <span>*</span> <span>*</span> <span>*</span> <span>*</span> <span>*</span> <span>*</span> It was at the siege of <i>Limerick</i>, an’ please your honour, replied the corporal, making a bow.</p>
			<p>The poor fellow and I, quoth my uncle <i>Toby</i>, addressing himself to my father, were scarce able to crawl out of our tents, at the time the siege of <i>Limerick</i> was raised, upon the very account you mention.⁠⸺⁠Now what can have got into that precious noddle of thine, my dear brother <i>Toby?</i> cried my father, mentally.⁠⸺⁠By Heaven! continued he, communing still with himself, it would puzzle an <i>Oedipus</i> to bring it in point.⁠⸺⁠</p>
			<p>I believe, an’ please your honour, quoth the corporal, that if it had not been for the quantity of brandy we set fire to every night, and the claret and cinnamon with which I plyed your honour off;⁠—And the geneva, <i>Trim</i>, added my uncle <i>Toby</i>, which did us more good than all⁠⸺⁠I verily believe, continued the corporal, we had both, an’ please your honour, left our lives in the trenches, and been buried in them too.⁠⸺⁠The noblest grave, corporal! cried my uncle <i>Toby</i>, his eyes sparkling as he spoke, that a soldier could wish to lie down in.⁠⸺⁠But a pitiful death for him! an’ please your honour, replied the corporal.</p>
			<p>All this was as much <i>Arabick</i> to my father, as the rites of the <i>Colchi</i> and <i>Troglodites</i> had been before to my uncle <i>Toby</i>; my father could not determine whether he was to frown or to smile.⁠⸺⁠</p>
			<p>My uncle <i>Toby</i>, turning to <i>Yorick</i>, resumed the case at <i>Limerick</i>, more intelligibly than he had begun it,⁠—and so settled the point for my father at once.</p>
