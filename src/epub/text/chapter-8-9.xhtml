				<p>I do not speak it with regard to the coarseness or cleanness of them⁠—or the strength of their gussets⁠⸺⁠but pray do not night-shifts differ from day-shifts as much in this particular, as in anything else in the world; That they so far exceed the others in length, that when you are laid down in them, they fall almost as much below the feet, as the day-shifts fall short of them?</p>
				<p>Widow <i>Wadman’s</i> night-shifts (as was the mode I suppose in King <i>William’s</i> and Queen <i>Anne’s</i> reigns) were cut however after this fashion; and if the fashion is changed (for in <i>Italy</i> they are come to nothing)⁠⸺⁠so much the worse for the public; they were two <i>Flemish</i> ells and a half in length; so that allowing a moderate woman two ells, she had half an ell to spare, to do what she would with.</p>
				<p>Now from one little indulgence gained after another, in the many bleak and decemberly nights of a seven years widowhood, things had insensibly come to this pass, and for the two last years had got establish’d into one of the ordinances of the bedchamber⁠—That as soon as <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> <i>Wadman</i> was put to bed, and had got her legs stretched down to the bottom of it, of which she always gave <i>Bridget</i> notice⁠—<i>Bridget</i>, with all suitable decorum, having first open’d the bedclothes at the feet, took hold of the half-ell of cloth we are speaking of, and having gently, and with both her hands, drawn it downwards to its furthest extension, and then contracted it again sidelong by four or five even plaits, she took a large corking pin out of her sleeve, and with the point directed towards her, pinn’d the plaits all fast together a little above the hem; which done, she tuck’d all in tight at the feet, and wish’d her mistress a good night.</p>
				<p>This was constant, and without any other variation than this; that on shivering and tempestuous nights, when <i>Bridget</i> untuck’d the feet of the bed, <abbr>etc.</abbr>, to do this⁠⸺⁠she consulted no thermometer but that of her own passions; and so performed it standing⁠—kneeling⁠—or squatting, according to the different degrees of faith, hope, and charity, she was in, and bore towards her mistress that night. In every other respect, the <em>etiquette</em> was sacred, and might have vied with the most mechanical one of the most inflexible bedchamber in <i>Christendom</i>.</p>
				<p>The first night, as soon as the corporal had conducted my uncle <i>Toby</i> upstairs, which was about ten⁠⸺⁠<abbr>Mrs.</abbr> <i>Wadman</i> threw herself into her armchair, and crossing her left knee with her right, which formed a resting-place for her elbow, she reclin’d her cheek upon the palm of her hand, and leaning forwards ruminated till midnight upon both sides of the question.</p>
				<p>The second night she went to her bureau, and having ordered <i>Bridget</i> to bring her up a couple of fresh candles and leave them upon the table, she took out her marriage-settlement, and read it over with great devotion: and the third night (which was the last of my uncle <i>Toby’s</i> stay) when <i>Bridget</i> had pull’d down the night-shift, and was assaying to stick in the corking pin⁠⸺⁠</p>
				<p>⸺⁠With a kick of both heels at once, but at the same time the most natural kick that could be kick’d in her situation⁠⸺⁠for supposing * * * * * * * * * to be the sun in its meridian, it was a northeast kick⁠⸺⁠she kick’d the pin out of her fingers⁠⸺⁠the <em>etiquette</em> which hung upon it, down⁠⸺⁠down it fell to the ground, and was shiver’d into a thousand atoms.</p>
				<p>From all which it was plain that widow <i>Wadman</i> was in love with my uncle <i>Toby</i>.</p>
