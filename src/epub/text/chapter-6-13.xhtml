			<p><i>Le Fever</i> got up to the Imperial army just time enough to try what metal his sword was made of, at the defeat of the <i>Turks</i> before <i>Belgrade</i>; but a series of unmerited mischances had pursued him from that moment, and trod close upon his heels for four years together after; he had withstood these buffetings to the last, till sickness overtook him at <i>Marseilles</i>, from whence he wrote my uncle <i>Toby</i> word, he had lost his time, his services, his health, and, in short, everything but his sword;⁠⸺⁠and was waiting for the first ship to return back to him.</p>
			<p>As this letter came to hand about six weeks before <i>Susannah’s</i> accident, <i>Le Fever</i> was hourly expected; and was uppermost in my uncle <i>Toby’s</i> mind all the time my father was giving him and <i>Yorick</i> a description of what kind of a person he would choose for a preceptor to me: but as my uncle <i>Toby</i> thought my father at first somewhat fanciful in the accomplishments he required, he forebore mentioning <i>Le Fever’s</i> name,⁠⸺⁠till the character, by <i>Yorick’s</i> interposition, ending unexpectedly, in one, who should be gentle-tempered, and generous, and good, it impressed the image of <i>Le Fever</i>, and his interest, upon my uncle <i>Toby</i> so forcibly, he rose instantly off his chair; and laying down his pipe, in order to take hold of both my father’s hands⁠⸺⁠I beg, brother <i>Shandy</i>, said my uncle <i>Toby</i>, I may recommend poor <i>Le Fever’s</i> son to you⁠⸺⁠I beseech you do, added <i>Yorick</i>⁠⸺⁠He has a good heart, said my uncle <i>Toby</i>⁠⸺⁠And a brave one too, an’ please your honour, said the corporal.</p>
			<p>⸺⁠The best hearts, <i>Trim</i>, are ever the bravest, replied my uncle <i>Toby</i>.⁠⸺⁠And the greatest cowards, an’ please your honour, in our regiment, were the greatest rascals in it.⁠⸺⁠There was serjeant <i>Kumber</i>, and ensign⁠⸻</p>
			<p>⸺⁠We’ll talk of them, said my father, another time.</p>
