			<p>With two strokes, the one at <i>Hippocrates</i>, the other at Lord <i>Verulam</i>, did my father achieve it.</p>
			<p>The stroke at the prince of physicians, with which he began, was no more than a short insult upon his sorrowful complaint of the Ars longa,⁠—and Vita brevis.⁠⸺⁠Life short, cried my father,⁠—and the art of healing tedious! And who are we to thank for both the one and the other, but the ignorance of quacks themselves,⁠—and the stage-loads of chymical nostrums, and peripatetic lumber, with which, in all ages, they have first flatter’d the world, and at last deceived it?</p>
			<p>⸺⁠O my lord <i>Verulam!</i> cried my father, turning from <i>Hippocrates</i>, and making his second stroke at him, as the principal of nostrum-mongers, and the fittest to be made an example of to the rest,⁠⸺⁠What shall I say to thee, my great lord <i>Verulam?</i> What shall I say to thy internal spirit,⁠—thy opium,⁠—thy saltpetre,⁠⸺⁠thy greasy unctions,⁠—thy daily purges,⁠—thy nightly clysters, and succedaneums?</p>
			<p>⸺⁠My father was never at a loss what to say to any man, upon any subject; and had the least occasion for the exordium of any man breathing: how he dealt with his lordship’s opinion,⁠⸺⁠you shall see;⁠⸺⁠but when⁠—I know not;⁠⸺⁠we must first see what his lordship’s opinion was.</p>
