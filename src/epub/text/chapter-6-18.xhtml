			<p>We should begin, said my father, turning himself half round in bed, and shifting his pillow a little towards my mother’s, as he opened the debate⁠⸺⁠We should begin to think, <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> <i>Shandy</i>, of putting this boy into breeches.⁠⸺⁠</p>
			<p>We should so,⁠—said my mother.⁠⸺⁠We defer it, my dear, quoth my father, shamefully.⁠⸻</p>
			<p>I think we do, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> <i>Shandy</i>,⁠—said my mother.</p>
			<p>⸺⁠Not but the child looks extremely well, said my father, in his vests and tunicks.⁠⸻</p>
			<p>⸻He does look very well in them,⁠—replied my mother.⁠⸻</p>
			<p>⸺⁠And for that reason it would be almost a sin, added my father, to take him out of ’em.⁠⸺⁠</p>
			<p>⸺⁠It would so,⁠—said my mother:⁠⸺⁠But indeed he is growing a very tall lad,⁠—rejoined my father.</p>
			<p>⸺⁠He is very tall for his age, indeed,⁠—said my mother.⁠⸺⁠</p>
			<p>⸺⁠I can not (making two syllables of it) imagine, quoth my father, who the deuce he takes after.⁠⸺⁠</p>
			<p>I cannot conceive, for my life,⁠—said my mother.⁠⸺⁠</p>
			<p>Humph!⁠⸺⁠said my father.</p>
			<p>(The dialogue ceased for a moment.)</p>
			<p>⸺⁠I am very short myself,⁠—continued my father gravely.</p>
			<p>You are very short, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> <i>Shandy</i>,⁠—said my mother.</p>
			<p>Humph! quoth my father to himself, a second time: in muttering which, he plucked his pillow a little further from my mother’s⁠—and turning about again, there was an end of the debate for three minutes and a half.</p>
			<p>⸺⁠When he gets these breeches made, cried my father in a higher tone, he’ll look like a beast in ’em.</p>
			<p>He will be very awkward in them at first, replied my mother.⁠⸺⁠</p>
			<p>⸺⁠And ’twill be lucky, if that’s the worst on’t, added my father.</p>
			<p>It will be very lucky, answered my mother.</p>
			<p>I suppose, replied my father,⁠—making some pause first,⁠—he’ll be exactly like other people’s children.⁠⸺⁠</p>
			<p>Exactly, said my mother.⁠⸻</p>
			<p>⸺⁠Though I shall be sorry for that, added my father: and so the debate stopp’d again.</p>
			<p>⸺⁠They should be of leather, said my father, turning him about again.⁠—</p>
			<p>They will last him, said my mother, the longest.</p>
			<p>But he can have no linings to ’em, replied my father.⁠⸻</p>
			<p>He cannot, said my mother.</p>
			<p>’Twere better to have them of fustian, quoth my father.</p>
			<p>Nothing can be better, quoth my mother.⁠⸻</p>
			<p>—Except dimity,⁠—replied my father:⁠⸺’Tis best of all,⁠—replied my mother.</p>
			<p>⸺⁠One must not give him his death, however,⁠—interrupted my father.</p>
			<p>By no means, said my mother:⁠⸺⁠and so the dialogue stood still again.</p>
			<p>I am resolved, however, quoth my father, breaking silence the fourth time, he shall have no pockets in them.⁠—</p>
			<p>⸺⁠There is no occasion for any, said my mother.⁠⸻</p>
			<p>I mean in his coat and waistcoat,⁠—cried my father.</p>
			<p>⸺⁠I mean so too,⁠—replied my mother.</p>
			<p>⸺⁠Though if he gets a gig or top⁠⸺⁠Poor souls! it is a crown and a sceptre to them,⁠—they should have where to secure it.⁠⸻</p>
			<p>Order it as you please, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> <i>Shandy</i>, replied my mother.⁠⸻</p>
			<p>⸺⁠But don’t you think it right? added my father, pressing the point home to her.</p>
			<p>Perfectly, said my mother, if it pleases you, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> <i>Shandy</i>.⁠⸻</p>
			<p>⸺⁠There’s for you! cried my father, losing temper⁠⸺⁠Pleases me!⁠⸺⁠You never will distinguish, <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> <i>Shandy</i>, nor shall I ever teach you to do it, betwixt a point of pleasure and a point of convenience.⁠⸺⁠This was on the <i>Sunday</i> night:⁠⸺⁠and further this chapter sayeth not.</p>
