			<p>When a man gives himself up to the government of a ruling passion,⁠—or, in other words, when his <b>Hobbyhorse</b> grows headstrong,⁠⸺⁠farewel cool reason and fair discretion!</p>
			<p>My uncle <i>Toby’s</i> wound was near well, and as soon as the surgeon recovered his surprise, and could get leave to say as much⁠⸺⁠he told him, ’twas just beginning to incarnate; and that if no fresh exfoliation happened, which there was no sign of,⁠—it would be dried up in five or six weeks. The sound of as many Olympiads, twelve hours before, would have conveyed an idea of shorter duration to my uncle <i>Toby’s</i> mind.⁠⸺⁠The succession of his ideas was now rapid,⁠—he broiled with impatience to put his design in execution;⁠⸺⁠and so, without consulting farther with any soul living,⁠—which, by the by, I think is right, when you are predetermined to take no one soul’s advice,⁠⸺⁠he privately ordered <i>Trim</i>, his man, to pack up a bundle of lint and dressings, and hire a chariot-and-four to be at the door exactly by twelve o’clock that day, when he knew my father would be upon ’Change.⁠⸺⁠So leaving a banknote upon the table for the surgeon’s care of him, and a letter of tender thanks for his brother’s⁠—he packed up his maps, his books of fortification, his instruments, <abbr>etc.</abbr>, and by the help of a crutch on one side, and <i>Trim</i> on the other,⁠⸺⁠my uncle <i>Toby</i> embarked for <i>Shandy-Hall</i>.</p>
			<p>The reason, or rather the rise of this sudden demigration was as follows:</p>
			<p>The table in my uncle <i>Toby’s</i> room, and at which, the night before this change happened, he was sitting with his maps, <abbr>etc.</abbr>, about him⁠—being somewhat of the smallest, for that infinity of great and small instruments of knowledge which usually lay crowded upon it⁠—he had the accident, in reaching over for his tobacco-box, to throw down his compasses, and in stooping to take the compasses up, with his sleeve he threw down his case of instruments and snuffers;⁠—and as the dice took a run against him, in his endeavouring to catch the snuffers in falling,⁠⸺⁠he thrust Monsieur <i>Blondel</i> off the table, and Count <i>de Pagan</i> o’top of him.</p>
			<p>’Twas to no purpose for a man, lame as my uncle <i>Toby</i> was, to think of redressing these evils by himself,⁠—he rung his bell for his man <i>Trim</i>;⁠⸻<i>Trim</i>, quoth my uncle <i>Toby</i>, prithee see what confusion I have here been making⁠—I must have some better contrivance, <i>Trim</i>.⁠⸺⁠Can’st not thou take my rule, and measure the length and breadth of this table, and then go and bespeak me one as big again?⁠⸺⁠Yes, an’ please your Honour, replied <i>Trim</i>, making a bow; but I hope your Honour will be soon well enough to get down to your country-seat, where,⁠—as your Honour takes so much pleasure in fortification, we could manage this matter to a T.</p>
			<p>I must here inform you, that this servant of my uncle <i>Toby’s</i>, who went by the name of <i>Trim</i>, had been a corporal in my uncle’s own company,⁠—his real name was <i>James Butler</i>,⁠—but having got the nickname of <i>Trim</i> in the regiment, my uncle <i>Toby</i>, unless when he happened to be very angry with him, would never call him by any other name.</p>
			<p>The poor fellow had been disabled for the service, by a wound on his left knee by a musket-bullet, at the battle of <i>Landen</i>, which was two years before the affair of <i>Namur</i>;⁠—and as the fellow was well-beloved in the regiment, and a handy fellow into the bargain, my uncle <i>Toby</i> took him for his servant; and of an excellent use was he, attending my uncle <i>Toby</i> in the camp and in his quarters as a valet, groom, barber, cook, sempster, and nurse; and indeed, from first to last, waited upon him and served him with great fidelity and affection.</p>
			<p>My uncle <i>Toby</i> loved the man in return, and what attached him more to him still, was the similitude of their knowledge.⁠⸺⁠For Corporal <i>Trim</i> (for so, for the future, I shall call him), by four years occasional attention to his Master’s discourse upon fortified towns, and the advantage of prying and peeping continually into his Master’s plans, <abbr>etc.</abbr>, exclusive and besides what he gained <b>Hobbyhorsically</b>, as a body-servant, <em>Non Hobbyhorsical per se</em>;⁠⸺⁠had become no mean proficient in the science; and was thought, by the cook and chambermaid, to know as much of the nature of strongholds as my uncle <i>Toby</i> himself.</p>
			<p>I have but one more stroke to give to finish Corporal <i>Trim’s</i> character,⁠⸺⁠and it is the only dark line in it.⁠—The fellow loved to advise,⁠—or rather to hear himself talk; his carriage, however, was so perfectly respectful, ’twas easy to keep him silent when you had him so; but set his tongue a-going,⁠—you had no hold of him⁠—he was voluble;⁠—the eternal interlardings of <em>your Honour</em>, with the respectfulness of Corporal <i>Trim’s</i> manner, interceding so strong in behalf of his elocution,⁠—that though you might have been incommoded,⁠⸺⁠you could not well be angry. My uncle <i>Toby</i> was seldom either the one or the other with him,⁠—or, at least, this fault, in <i>Trim</i>, broke no squares with them. My uncle <i>Toby</i>, as I said, loved the man;⁠⸺⁠and besides, as he ever looked upon a faithful servant,⁠—but as an humble friend,⁠—he could not bear to stop his mouth.⁠⸺⁠Such was Corporal <i>Trim</i>.</p>
			<p>If I durst presume, continued <i>Trim</i>, to give your Honour my advice, and speak my opinion in this matter.⁠—Thou art welcome, <i>Trim</i>, quoth my uncle <i>Toby</i>⁠—speak,⁠⸺⁠speak what thou thinkest upon the subject, man, without fear. Why then, replied <i>Trim</i> (not hanging his ears and scratching his head like a country-lout, but) stroking his hair back from his forehead, and standing erect as before his division,⁠—I think, quoth <i>Trim</i>, advancing his left, which was his lame leg, a little forwards,⁠—and pointing with his right hand open towards a map of <i>Dunkirk</i>, which was pinned against the hangings,⁠⸺⁠I think, quoth Corporal <i>Trim</i>, with humble submission to your Honour’s better judgment,⁠⸺⁠that these ravelins, bastions, curtins, and horn-works, make but a poor, contemptible, fiddle-faddle piece of work of it here upon paper, compared to what your Honour and I could make of it were we in the country by ourselves, and had but a rood, or a rood and a half of ground to do what we pleased with: As summer is coming on, continued <i>Trim</i>, your Honour might sit out of doors, and give me the nography⁠—(Call it ichnography, quoth my uncle)⁠⸺⁠of the town or citadel, your Honour was pleased to sit down before,⁠—and I will be shot by your Honour upon the glacis of it, if I did not fortify it to your Honour’s mind⁠⸺⁠I dare say thou would’st, <i>Trim</i>, quoth my uncle.⁠—For if your Honour, continued the Corporal, could but mark me the polygon, with its exact lines and angles⁠—That I could do very well, quoth my uncle.⁠—I would begin with the fossé, and if your Honour could tell me the proper depth and breadth⁠—I can to a hair’s breadth, <i>Trim</i>, replied my uncle.⁠—I would throw out the earth upon this hand towards the town for the scarp,⁠—and on that hand towards the campaign for the counterscarp.⁠—Very right, <i>Trim</i>, quoth my uncle <i>Toby</i>:⁠⸺⁠And when I had sloped them to your mind,⁠⸺⁠an’ please your Honour, I would face the glacis, as the finest fortifications are done in <i>Flanders</i>, with sods,⁠⸺⁠and as your Honour knows they should be,⁠—and I would make the walls and parapets with sods too.⁠—The best engineers call them gazons, <i>Trim</i>, said my uncle <i>Toby</i>.⁠⸺⁠Whether they are gazons or sods, is not much matter, replied <i>Trim</i>; your Honour knows they are ten times beyond a facing either of brick or stone.⁠⸺⁠I know they are, <i>Trim</i>, in some respects,⁠⸺⁠quoth my uncle <i>Toby</i>, nodding his head;⁠—for a cannonball enters into the gazon right onwards, without bringing any rubbish down with it, which might fill the fossé (as was the case at <i><abbr>St.</abbr> Nicolas’s</i> gate), and facilitate the passage over it.</p>
			<p>Your Honour understands these matters, replied Corporal <i>Trim</i>, better than any officer in his Majesty’s service;⁠⸺⁠but would your Honour please to let the bespeaking of the table alone, and let us but go into the country, I would work under your Honour’s directions like a horse, and make fortifications for you something like a tansy, with all their batteries, saps, ditches, and palisadoes, that it should be worth all the world’s riding twenty miles to go and see it.</p>
			<p>My uncle <i>Toby</i> blushed as red as scarlet as <i>Trim</i> went on;⁠—but it was not a blush of guilt,⁠—of modesty,⁠—or of anger,⁠—it was a blush of joy;⁠—he was fired with Corporal <i>Trim’s</i> project and description.⁠⸺⁠<i>Trim!</i> said my uncle <i>Toby</i>, thou hast said enough.⁠—We might begin the campaign, continued <i>Trim</i>, on the very day that his Majesty and the Allies take the field, and demolish them town by town as fast as⁠—<i>Trim</i>, quoth my uncle <i>Toby</i>, say no more. Your Honour, continued <i>Trim</i>, might sit in your armchair (pointing to it) this fine weather, giving me your orders, and I would⁠⸺⁠Say no more, <i>Trim</i>, quoth my uncle <i>Toby</i>⁠⸺⁠Besides, your Honour would get not only pleasure and good pastime,⁠—but good air, and good exercise, and good health,⁠—and your Honour’s wound would be well in a month. Thou hast said enough, <i>Trim</i>,⁠—quoth my uncle <i>Toby</i> (putting his hand into his breeches-pocket)⁠⸺⁠I like thy project mightily.⁠—And if your Honour pleases, I’ll this moment go and buy a pioneer’s spade to take down with us, and I’ll bespeak a shovel and a pickaxe, and a couple of⁠⸺⁠Say no more, <i>Trim</i>, quoth my uncle <i>Toby</i>, leaping up upon one leg, quite overcome with rapture,⁠—and thrusting a guinea into <i>Trim’s</i> hand,⁠—<i>Trim</i>, said my uncle <i>Toby</i>, say no more;⁠—but go down, <i>Trim</i>, this moment, my lad, and bring up my supper this instant.</p>
			<p><i>Trim</i> ran down and brought up his master’s supper,⁠⸺⁠to no purpose:⁠—<i>Trim’s</i> plan of operation ran so in my uncle <i>Toby’s</i> head, he could not taste it.⁠—<i>Trim</i>, quoth my uncle <i>Toby</i>, get me to bed.⁠—’Twas all one.⁠—Corporal <i>Trim’s</i> description had fired his imagination,⁠—my uncle <i>Toby</i> could not shut his eyes.⁠—The more he considered it, the more bewitching the scene appeared to him;⁠—so that, two full hours before daylight, he had come to a final determination, and had concerted the whole plan of his and Corporal <i>Trim’s</i> decampment.</p>
			<p>My uncle <i>Toby</i> had a little neat country-house of his own, in the village where my father’s estate lay at <i>Shandy</i>, which had been left him by an old uncle, with a small estate of about one hundred pounds a-year. Behind this house, and contiguous to it, was a kitchen-garden of about half an acre; and at the bottom of the garden, and cut off from it by a tall yew hedge, was a bowling-green, containing just about as much ground as Corporal <i>Trim</i> wished for;⁠—so that as <i>Trim</i> uttered the words, “A rood and a half of ground to do what they would with,”⁠—this identical bowling-green instantly presented itself, and became curiously painted all at once, upon the retina of my uncle <i>Toby’s</i> fancy;⁠—which was the physical cause of making him change colour, or at least of heightening his blush, to that immoderate degree I spoke of.</p>
			<p>Never did lover post down to a beloved mistress with more heat and expectation, than my uncle <i>Toby</i> did, to enjoy this selfsame thing in private;⁠—I say in private;⁠—for it was sheltered from the house, as I told you, by a tall yew hedge, and was covered on the other three sides, from mortal sight, by rough holly and thickset flowering shrubs:⁠—so that the idea of not being seen, did not a little contribute to the idea of pleasure preconceived in my uncle <i>Toby’s</i> mind.⁠—Vain thought! however thick it was planted about,⁠⸺⁠or private soever it might seem,⁠—to think, dear uncle <i>Toby</i>, of enjoying a thing which took up a whole rood and a half of ground,⁠⸺⁠and not have it known!</p>
			<p>How my uncle <i>Toby</i> and Corporal <i>Trim</i> managed this matter,⁠⸺⁠with the history of their campaigns, which were no way barren of events,⁠⸺⁠may make no uninteresting under-plot in the epitasis and working-up of this drama.⁠—At present the scene must drop,⁠—and change for the parlour fireside.</p>
