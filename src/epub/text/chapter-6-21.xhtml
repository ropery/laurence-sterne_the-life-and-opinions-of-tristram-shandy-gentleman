			<p>If the reader has not a clear conception of the rood and the half of ground which lay at the bottom of my uncle <i>Toby’s</i> kitchen-garden, and which was the scene of so many of his delicious hours,⁠—the fault is not in me,⁠—but in his imagination;⁠—for I am sure I gave him so minute a description, I was almost ashamed of it.</p>
			<p>When <b>Fate</b> was looking forwards one afternoon, into the great transactions of future times,⁠—and recollected for what purposes this little plot, by a decree fast bound down in iron, had been destined,⁠⸺⁠she gave a nod to <b>Nature</b>,⁠—’twas enough⁠—Nature threw half a spade full of her kindliest compost upon it, with just so <em>much</em> clay in it, as to retain the forms of angles and indentings,⁠—and so <em>little</em> of it too, as not to cling to the spade, and render works of so much glory, nasty in foul weather.</p>
			<p>My uncle <i>Toby</i> came down, as the reader has been informed, with plans along with him, of almost every fortified town in <i>Italy</i> and <i>Flanders</i>; so let the Duke of <i>Marlborough</i>, or the allies, have set down before what town they pleased, my uncle <i>Toby</i> was prepared for them.</p>
			<p>His way, which was the simplest one in the world, was this; as soon as ever a town was invested⁠—(but sooner when the design was known) to take the plan of it (let it be what town it would), and enlarge it upon a scale to the exact size of his bowling-green; upon the surface of which, by means of a large role of packthread, and a number of small piquets driven into the ground, at the several angles and redans, he transferred the lines from his paper; then taking the profile of the place, with its works, to determine the depths and slopes of the ditches,⁠—the talus of the glacis, and the precise height of the several banquets, parapets, <abbr>etc.</abbr>⁠—he set the corporal to work⁠⸺⁠and sweetly went it on:⁠⸺⁠The nature of the soil,⁠—the nature of the work itself,⁠—and above all, the good-nature of my uncle <i>Toby</i> sitting by from morning to night, and chatting kindly with the corporal upon past-done deeds,⁠—left <strong>labour</strong> little else but the ceremony of the name.</p>
			<p>When the place was finished in this manner, and put into a proper posture of defence,⁠—it was invested,⁠—and my uncle <i>Toby</i> and the corporal began to run their first parallel.⁠⸺⁠I beg I may not be interrupted in my story, by being told, <em>That the first parallel should be at least three hundred toises distant from the main body of the place,⁠—and that I have not left a single inch for it</em>;⁠⸻for my uncle <i>Toby</i> took the liberty of encroaching upon his kitchen-garden, for the sake of enlarging his works on the bowling-green, and for that reason generally ran his first and second parallels betwixt two rows of his cabbages and his cauliflowers; the conveniences and inconveniences of which will be considered at large in the history of my uncle <i>Toby’s</i> and the corporal’s campaigns, of which, this I’m now writing is but a sketch, and will be finished, if I conjecture right, in three pages (but there is no guessing)⁠⸺⁠The campaigns themselves will take up as many books; and therefore I apprehend it would be hanging too great a weight of one kind of matter in so flimsy a performance as this, to rhapsodize them, as I once intended, into the body of the work⁠⸺⁠surely they had better be printed apart,⁠⸺⁠we’ll consider the affair⁠⸺⁠so take the following sketch of them in the meantime.</p>
