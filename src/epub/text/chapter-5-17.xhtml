			<p>⸺’Twas nothing,⁠—I did not lose two drops of blood by it⁠⸺⸺’twas not worth calling in a surgeon, had he lived next door to us⁠⸺⁠thousands suffer by choice, what I did by accident.⁠⸺⁠Doctor <i>Slop</i> made ten times more of it, than there was occasion:⁠⸺⁠some men rise, by the art of hanging great weights upon small wires,⁠—and I am this day (<i>August</i> the 10th, 1761) paying part of the price of this man’s reputation.⁠⸺⁠O ’twould provoke a stone, to see how things are carried on in this world!⁠⸺⁠The chambermaid had left no ******* *** under the bed:⁠⸺⁠Cannot you contrive, master, quoth <i>Susannah</i>, lifting up the sash with one hand, as she spoke, and helping me up into the window-seat with the other,⁠—cannot you manage, my dear, for a single time, to **** *** ** *** ******?</p>
			<p>I was five years old.⁠⸺⁠<i>Susannah</i> did not consider that nothing was well hung in our family,⁠⸺⁠so slap came the sash down like lightning upon us;⁠—Nothing is left,⁠—cried <i>Susannah</i>,⁠—nothing is left⁠—for me, but to run my country.⁠⸺⁠</p>
			<p>My uncle <i>Toby’s</i> house was a much kinder sanctuary; and so <i>Susannah</i> fled to it.</p>
