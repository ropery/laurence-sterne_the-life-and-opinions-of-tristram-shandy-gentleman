			<p>There is not a town in all <i>France</i>, which, in my opinion, looks better in the map, than <b>Montreuil</b>;⁠⸺⁠I own, it does not look so well in the book of post-roads; but when you come to see it⁠—to be sure it looks most pitifully.</p>
			<p>There is one thing, however, in it at present very handsome; and that is, the innkeeper’s daughter: She has been eighteen months at <i>Amiens</i>, and six at <i>Paris</i>, in going through her classes; so knits, and sews, and dances, and does the little coquetries very well.⁠⸺⁠</p>
			<p>—A slut! in running them over within these five minutes that I have stood looking at her, she has let fall at least a dozen loops in a white thread stocking⁠⸺⁠yes, yes⁠—I see, you cunning gipsy!⁠—’tis long and taper⁠—you need not pin it to your knee⁠—and that ’tis your own⁠—and fits you exactly.⁠⸺⁠</p>
			<p>⸺⁠That Nature should have told this creature a word about a <em>statue’s thumb</em>!</p>
			<p>—But as this sample is worth all their thumbs⁠⸺⁠besides, I have her thumbs and fingers in at the bargain, if they can be any guide to me,⁠—and as <i>Janatone</i> withal (for that is her name) stands so well for a drawing⁠⸺⁠may I never draw more, or rather may I draw like a draught-horse, by main strength all the days of my life,⁠—if I do not draw her in all her proportions, and with as determined a pencil, as if I had her in the wettest drapery.⁠⸺⁠</p>
			<p>—But your worships choose rather that I give you the length, breadth, and perpendicular height of the great parish-church, or drawing of the façade of the abbey of Saint <i>Austerberte</i> which has been transported from <i>Artois</i> hither⁠—everything is just I suppose as the masons and carpenters left them,⁠—and if the belief in <i>Christ</i> continues so long, will be so these fifty years to come⁠—so your worships and reverences may all measure them at your leisures⁠⸺⁠but he who measures thee, <i>Janatone</i>, must do it now⁠—thou carriest the principles of change within thy frame; and considering the chances of a transitory life, I would not answer for thee a moment; ere twice twelve months are passed and gone, thou mayest grow out like a pumpkin, and lose thy shapes⁠⸺⁠or thou mayest go off like a flower, and lose thy beauty⁠—nay, thou mayest go off like a hussy⁠—and lose thyself.⁠—I would not answer for my aunt <i>Dinah</i>, was she alive⁠⸺’faith, scarce for her picture⁠⸺⁠were it but painted by <i>Reynolds</i>⁠—</p>
			<p>But if I go on with my drawing, after naming that son of <i>Apollo</i>, I’ll be shot⁠⸺⁠</p>
			<p>So you must e’en be content with the original; which, if the evening is fine in passing thro’ <i>Montreuil</i>, you will see at your chaise-door, as you change horses: but unless you have as bad a reason for haste as I have⁠—you had better stop:⁠⸺⁠She has a little of the <i xml:lang="fr">devote</i>: but that, sir, is a terce to a nine in your favour⁠⸻</p>
			<p>—L⁠—help me! I could not count a single point: so had been piqued and repiqued, and capotted to the devil.</p>
