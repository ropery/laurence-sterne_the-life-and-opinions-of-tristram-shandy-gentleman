			<p>My dear mother, quoth the novice, coming a little to herself,⁠⸺⁠there are two certain words, which I have been told will force any horse, or ass, or mule, to go up a hill whether he will or no; be he never so obstinate or ill-will’d, the moment he hears them utter’d, he obeys. They are words magic! cried the abbess in the utmost horror⁠—No; replied <i>Margarita</i> calmly⁠—but they are words sinful⁠—What are they? quoth the abbess, interrupting her: They are sinful in the first degree, answered <i>Margarita</i>,⁠—they are mortal⁠—and if we are ravish’d and die unabsolved of them, we shall both⁠⸺⁠but you may pronounce them to me, quoth the abbess of <i>Andoüillets</i>⁠⸺⁠They cannot, my dear mother, said the novice, be pronounced at all; they will make all the blood in one’s body fly up into one’s face⁠—But you may whisper them in my ear, quoth the abbess.</p>
			<p>Heaven! hadst thou no guardian angel to delegate to the inn at the bottom of the hill? was there no generous and friendly spirit unemployed⁠⸺⁠no agent in nature, by some monitory shivering, creeping along the artery which led to his heart, to rouse the muleteer from his banquet?⁠⸺⁠no sweet minstrelsy to bring back the fair idea of the abbess and <i>Margarita</i>, with their black rosaries!</p>
			<p>Rouse! rouse!⁠⸺⁠but ’tis too late⁠—the horrid words are pronounced this moment⁠⸺⁠</p>
			<p>⸺⁠and how to tell them⁠—Ye, who can speak of everything existing, with unpolluted lips, instruct me⁠⸺⁠guide me⁠⸺⁠</p>
