			<p>All womankind, continued <i>Trim</i>, (commenting upon his story) from the highest to the lowest, an’ please your honour, love jokes; the difficulty is to know how they choose to have them cut; and there is no knowing that, but by trying, as we do with our artillery in the field, by raising or letting down their breeches, till we hit the mark.⁠⸺⁠</p>
			<p>⸺⁠I like the comparison, said my uncle <i>Toby</i>, better than the thing itself⁠⸺⁠</p>
			<p>⸺⁠Because your honour, quoth the corporal, loves glory, more than pleasure.</p>
			<p>I hope, <i>Trim</i>, answered my uncle <i>Toby</i>, I love mankind more than either; and as the knowledge of arms tends so apparently to the good and quiet of the world⁠⸺⁠and particularly that branch of it which we have practised together in our bowling-green, has no object but to shorten the strides of <b>Ambition</b>, and intrench the lives and fortunes of the <em>few</em>, from the plunderings of the <em>many</em>⁠⸺⁠whenever that drum beats in our ears, I trust, corporal, we shall neither of us want so much humanity and fellow-feeling, as to face about and march.</p>
			<p>In pronouncing this, my uncle <i>Toby</i> faced about, and march’d firmly as at the head of his company⁠⸺⁠and the faithful corporal, shouldering his stick, and striking his hand upon his coat-skirt as he took his first step⁠⸺⁠march’d close behind him down the avenue.</p>
			<p>⸺⁠Now what can their two noddles be about? cried my father to my mother⁠⸺⁠by all that’s strange, they are besieging <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> <i>Wadman</i> in form, and are marching round her house to mark out the lines of circumvallation.</p>
			<p>I dare say, quoth my mother⁠⸻⸻But stop, dear Sir⁠⸺⁠for what my mother dared to say upon the occasion⁠⸺⁠and what my father did say upon it⁠⸺⁠with her replies and his rejoinders, shall be read, perused, paraphrased, commented, and descanted upon⁠—or to say it all in a word, shall be thumb’d over by Posterity in a chapter apart⁠⸺⁠I say, by Posterity⁠—and care not, if I repeat the word again⁠—for what has this book done more than the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Legation of Moses</i>, or the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Tale of a Tub</i>, that it may not swim down the gutter of Time along with them?</p>
			<p>I will not argue the matter: Time wastes too fast: every letter I trace tells me with what rapidity Life follows my pen; the days and hours of it, more precious, my dear <i>Jenny!</i> than the rubies about thy neck, are flying over our heads like light clouds of a windy day, never to return more⁠⸺⁠everything presses on⁠⸺⁠whilst thou art twisting that lock,⁠⸺⁠see! it grows grey; and every time I kiss thy hand to bid adieu, and every absence which follows it, are preludes to that eternal separation which we are shortly to make.⁠⸺⁠</p>
			<p>⸺⁠Heaven have mercy upon us both!</p>
