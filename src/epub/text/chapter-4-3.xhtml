			<p>Did ever man, brother <i>Toby</i>, cried my father, raising himself upon his elbow, and turning himself round to the opposite side of the bed, where my uncle <i>Toby</i> was sitting in his old fringed chair, with his chin resting upon his crutch⁠⸺⁠did ever a poor unfortunate man, brother <i>Toby</i>, cried my father, receive so many lashes?⁠⸺⁠The most I ever saw given, quoth my uncle <i>Toby</i> (ringing the bell at the bed’s head for <i>Trim</i>) was to a grenadier, I think in <i>Mackay’s</i> regiment.</p>
