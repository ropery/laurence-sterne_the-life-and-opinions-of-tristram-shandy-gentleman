			<p>I am a <i>Turk</i> if I had not as much forgot my mother, as if Nature had plaistered me up, and set me down naked upon the banks of the river <i>Nile</i>, without one.⁠⸺⁠Your most obedient servant, Madam⁠—I’ve cost you a great deal of trouble,⁠—I wish it may answer;⁠—but you have left a crack in my back,⁠—and here’s a great piece fallen off here before,⁠—and what must I do with this foot?⁠⸺⁠I shall never reach <i>England</i> with it.</p>
			<p>For my own part, I never wonder at anything;⁠—and so often has my judgment deceived me in my life, that I always suspect it, right or wrong,⁠—at least I am seldom hot upon cold subjects. For all this, I reverence truth as much as anybody; and when it has slipped us, if a man will but take me by the hand, and go quietly and search for it, as for a thing we have both lost, and can neither of us do well without,⁠—I’ll go to the world’s end with him:⁠⸺⁠But I hate disputes,⁠—and therefore (bating religious points, or such as touch society) I would almost subscribe to anything which does not choke me in the first passage, rather than be drawn into one.⁠⸺⁠But I cannot bear suffocation,⁠⸺⁠and bad smells worst of all.⁠⸺⁠For which reasons, I resolved from the beginning, That if ever the army of martyrs was to be augmented,⁠—or a new one raised,⁠—I would have no hand in it, one way or t’other.</p>
